In this tutorial, we will introduce emerging technologies on computational imaging and light field projection to AR/MR researchers.Light is the most important medium in AR/VR technologies to not only obtain information but also show and modify visual cue in the real scenes. Therefore in this area, latest techniques on optics, imaging and lighting have played an important role to make a next step toward the sophisticated experiences. Computational photography is one of the most influential technology in computer vision and optical engineering areas, and we think most techniques in computational imaging and projection can be applied to common problems in mixed reality, such as scene modeling, modification of the appearances of actual objects and user interactions.},

	Abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) in microscopic surgery has been subject of several studies in the past two decades. Nevertheless, AR has not found its way into everyday microsurgical workflows. The introduction of new surgical microscopes equipped with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the surgeons to perform multimodal (optical and OCT) imaging in the operating room. Taking full advantage of such elaborate source of information requires sophisticated intraoperative image fusion, information extraction, guidance and visualization methods. Medical AR is a unique approach to facilitate utilization of multimodal medical imaging devices. Here we propose a novel medical AR solution to the long-known problem of determining the distance between the surgical instrument tip and the underlying tissue in ophthalmic surgery to further pave the way of AR into the surgical theater. Our method brings augmented reality to OCT for the first time by augmenting the surgeon's view of the OCT images with an estimated instrument cross-section shape and distance to the retinal surface using only information from the shadow of the instrument in intraoperative OCT images. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in retinal surgery using a phantom eye and evaluate the accuracy of the augmented information using a micromanipulator.},

	Abstract = {Image-guided medical interventions more frequently rely on Augmented Reality (AR) visualization to enable surgical navigation. Current systems use 2-D monitors to present the view from external cameras, which does not provide an ideal perception of the 3-D position of the region of interest. Despite this problem, most research targets the direct overlay of diagnostic imaging data, and only few studies attempt to improve the perception of occluded structures in external camera views. The focus of this paper lies on improving the 3-D perception of an augmented external camera view by combining both auditory and visual stimuli in a dynamic multi-sensory AR environment for medical applications. Our approach is based on Temporal Distance Coding (TDC) and an active surgical tool to interact with occluded virtual objects of interest in the scene in order to gain an improved perception of their 3-D location. Users performed a simulated needle biopsy by targeting virtual lesions rendered inside a patient phantom. Experimental results demonstrate that our TDC-based visualization technique significantly improves the localization accuracy, while the addition of auditory feedback results in increased intuitiveness and faster completion of the task.},

The final two experiments demonstrated that there were no relative and location-specific errors induced by the mirror showing the feasibility of the RGBDX-ray imaging system.

The vertical direction may be easily obtained by detecting the vertical vanishing points with computer vision techniques, or with the aid of IMU sensor measurements from a smartphone. Our solver is general and able to compute absolute camera pose from two 2D-3D correspondences for single or multi-camera systems. We run several synthetic experiments that demonstrate our algorithm's improved robustness to image and IMU noise compared to the current state of the art. Additionally, we run an image localization experiment that demonstrates the accuracy of our algorithm in real-world scenarios. Finally, we show that our algorithm provides increased performance for real-time model-based tracking compared to solvers that do not utilize the vertical direction and show our algorithm in use with an augmented reality application running on a Google Tango tablet.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a dual, wide area, collaborative augmented reality (AR) system that consists of standard live view augmentation, e.g., from helmet, and zoomed-in view augmentation, e.g., from binoculars. The proposed advanced scouting capability allows long range high precision augmentation of live unaided and zoomed-in imagery with aerial and terrain based synthetic objects, vehicles, people and effects. The inserted objects must appear stable in the display and not jitter or drift as the user moves around and examines the scene. The AR insertions for the binocs must work instantly when they are picked up anywhere as the user moves around. The design of both AR modules is based on using two different cameras with wide and narrow field of view (FoV) lenses. The wide FoV gives context and enables the recovery of location and orientation of the prop in 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) much more robustly, whereas the narrow FoV is used for the actual augmentation and increased precision in tracking. Furthermore, narrow camera in unaided eye and wide camera on the binoculars are jointly used for global yaw (heading) correction. We present our navigation algorithms using monocular cameras in combination with IMU and GPS in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework to obtain robust and real-time pose estimation for precise augmentation and cooperative tracking.},

For live streaming applications, compression is critical to reduce the bitrate. Omnidirectional videos, which are spherical in nature, are mapped onto one or more planes before encoding to interface with modern video coding standards. In this paper, we consider the problem of evaluating the coding efficiency in the context of viewing with a head-mounted display. We extract viewport based head motion trajectories, and compare the original and coded videos on the viewport. With this approach, we compare different sphere-to-plane mappings. We show that the average viewport quality can be approximated by a weighted spherical PSNR.},

Recent research has shown that even photorealistic augmentations with consistent illumination are possible. A method, achieving this first, distributed lighting computations and the extraction of the important light sources. To reach real-time frame rates on a mobile device, the number of these extracted light sources must be low, limiting the scope of possible illumination scenarios and the quality of shadows. In this paper, we show how to reduce the computational cost per light using a combination of tile-based rendering and frustum culling techniques tailored for AR applications. Our approach runs entirely on the GPU and does not require any precomputation. Without reducing the displayed image quality, we achieve up to 2.2× speedup for typical AR scenarios.},

	Abstract = {In Augmented Reality (AR) with an Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display (OST-HMD), the spatial calibration between a user's eye and the display screen is a crucial issue in realizing seamless AR experiences. A successful calibration hinges upon proper modeling of the display system which is conceptually broken down into an eye part and an HMD part. This paper breaks the HMD part down even further to investigate optical aberration issues. The display optics causes two different optical aberrations that degrade the calibration quality: the distortion of incoming light from the physical world, and that of light from the image source of the HMD. While methods exist for correcting either of the two distortions independently, there is, to our knowledge, no method which corrects for both simultaneously. This paper proposes a calibration method that corrects both of the two distortions simultaneously for an arbitrary eye position given an OST-HMD system. We expand a light-field (LF) correction approach [8] originally designed for the former distortion. Our method is camera-based and has an offline learning and an online correction step. We verify our method in exemplary calibrations of two different OST-HMDs: a professional and a consumer OST-HMD. The results show that our method significantly improves the calibration quality compared to a conventional method with the accuracy comparable to 20/50 visual acuity. The results also indicate that only by correcting both the distortions simultaneously can improve the quality.},

	Abstract = {An effective interaction in augmented reality (AR) requires utilization of different modalities. In this study, we investigated orienting the user in bimodal AR. Using auditory perception to support visual perception provides a useful approach for orienting the user to directions that are outside of the visual field-of-view (FOV). In particular, this is important in path-finding, where points-of-interest (POIs) can be all around the user. However, the ability to perceive the audio POIs is affected by the ventriloquism effect (VE), which means that audio POIs are captured by visual POIs. We measured the spatial limits for the VE in AR using a video see-through head-worn display. The results showed that the amount of the VE in AR was approx. 5$\,^{\circ}$--15$\,^{\circ}$ higher than in a real environment. In AR, spatial disparity between an audio and visual POI should be at least 30$\,^{\circ}$ of azimuth angle, in order to perceive the audio and visual POIs as separate. The limit was affected by azimuth angle of visual POI and magnitude of head rotations. These results provide guidelines for designing bimodal AR systems.},

In this paper we solve this shortcoming by introducing a method for physics-based non-rigid augmented reality. Singularities caused by topological changes are detected by analyzing the displacement field of the underlying deformable model. These topological changes are then applied to the physics-based model to approximate the real cut. All these steps, from deformation to cutting simulation, are performed in real-time. This significantly improves the coherence between the actual view and the model, and provides added value.},

	Abstract = {C-arm fluoroscopes are frequently used during surgeries for intraoperative guidance. Unfortunately, due to X-ray emission and scattering, increased radiation exposure occurs in the operating theatre. The objective of this work is to sensitize the surgeon to their radiation exposure, enable them to check on their exposure over time, and to help them choose their best position related to the C-arm gantry during surgery. First, we aim at simulating the amount of radiation that reaches the surgeon using the Geant4 software, a toolkit developed by CERN. Using a flexible setup in which two RGB-D cameras are mounted to the mobile C-arm, the scene is captured and modeled respectively. After the simulation of particles with specific energies, the dose at the surgeon's position, determined by the depth cameras, can be measured. The validation was performed by comparing the simulation results to both theoretical values from the C-arms user manual and real measurements made with a QUART didoSVM dosimeter. The average error was 16.46% and 16.39%, respectively. The proposed flexible setup and high simulation precision without a calibration with measured dosimeter values, has great potential to be directly used and integrated intraoperatively for dose measurement.},

	Abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) can merge real and virtual worlds seamlessly. This paper proposes a method to realize smooth collaboration using a remote MR, which makes it possible for geographically distributed users to share the same objects and communicate in real time as if they are at the same place. In this paper, we consider a situation where the users at local and remote sites perform a collaborative work, and real objects to be operated exist only at the local site. It is necessary to share the real objects between the two sites. However, prior studies have shown sharing real objects by duplication is either too costly or unrealistic. Therefore, we propose a method to share the objects by virtualizing the real objects using Computer Vision (CV) and then rendering the virtualized objects using MR. We have proposed a remote collaborative work system to create a smoother user experience for collaborative work with virtualized objects for remote users. Through experiments, we confirmed the effectiveness of our approach.},

	Abstract = {This paper aims at accurate and efficient pose tracking of planar targets on modern smartphones. Existing methods, relying on either visual features or motion sensing based on built-in inertial sensors, are either too computationally expensive to achieve realtime performance on a smartphone, or too noisy to achieve sufficient tracking accuracy. In this paper we present a hybrid tracking method which can achieve real-time performance with high accuracy. Based on the same framework of a state-of-the-art visual feature tracking algorithm [5] which ensures accurate and reliable pose tracking, the proposed hybrid method significantly reduces its computational cost with the assistance of a phone's built-in inertial sensors. However, noises in inertial sensors and abrupt errors in feature tracking due to severe motion blurs could result in instability of the hybrid tracking system. To address this problem, we propose to employ an adaptive Kalman filter with abrupt error detection to robustly fuse the inertial and feature tracking results.

	Abstract = {Fusing intraoperative X-ray data with real-time video in a common reference frame is not trivial since both modalities have to be acquired from the same viewpoint. The goal of this work is to design a flexible system comprising two RGBD sensors that can be attached to any mobile C-arm, with the objective of synthesizing projective color images from the X-ray source viewpoint. To achieve this, we calibrate the RGBD sensors to the X-ray source with a 3D calibration object. Then, we synthesize the projective color image from the X-ray viewpoint by applying a volumetric-based rendering method. Finally, the X-ray image is overlaid on the projective image without any further registration, offering a multimodal visualization of X-ray and color images. In this paper we present the different steps of development (i.e. hardware setup, calibration and rendering algorithm) and discuss clinical applications for the new video augmented C-arm. By placing X-ray markers on a hand patient and a spine model, we show that the overlay accuracy between the X-ray image and the synthetized image is in average 1.7 mm.},

	Abstract = {To help the computing device always understand the spacial relationship between the user's gesture and the ambient objects, a methodology is proposed to find the user's virtual eye center in the wearable camera coordinate system and then calculate accurately where a user is pointing at to perform the natural interaction. First, the wearable RGB-D sensor is affixed around the user forehead. A tool-free calibration is done by having the user move their fingers along their lines of sight from his eye center to the random selected targets. The fingertips are detected in the depth camera and then the interaction of these lines of sight is calculated. Then we present how to find where the user is pointing at in different scenarios with a depth map, a detected object and a controlled virtual element. To validate our methods, we perform a point-to-screen experiment. Results demonstrate that when a user is interacting with a display up to 1.5 meters away, our natural gesture interface has an average error of 2.1cm. In conclusion, the presented technique is a viable option for a reliable user interaction.},

In this work, we are dealing with static cameras and their usability for interactive augmented reality applications. Knowing that the camera does not move makes camera pose estimation both less and more difficult - one does not have to deal with pose change in time, but on the other hand, obtaining some level of understanding of the scene from a single viewpoint is challenging. We propose several ways how to gain advantage from the camera being static and a pipeline of a system for broadcasting a video stream enriched by information needed for its interactive visual augmenting - Interactive Camera Streams, INCAST.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an interaction system in which the appearance of the image displayed on a mobile display is consistent with that of the real space and that enables a user to interact with virtual objects overlaid on the image using the user's hand. The three-dimensional scene obtained by a depth camera is projected according to the user's viewpoint position obtained by face tracking, and the see-through image whose appearance is consistent with that outside the mobile display is generated. Interaction with virtual objects is realized by using the depth information obtained by the depth camera. To move virtual objects as if they were in real space, virtual objects are rendered in the world coordinate system that is fixed to a real scene even if the mobile display moves, and the direction of gravitational force added to virtual objects is made consistent with that of the world coordinate system. The former is realized by using the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm and the latter is realized by using the information obtained by an accelerometer. Thus, natural interaction with virtual objects using the user's hand is realized.},

Currently, there are no standard protocols to assess motor dysfunction in various patient groups, where each medical discipline uses subjectively scored clinical tests, qualitative video analysis, or marker-based motion capturing. We investigate the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) combined with serious gaming and marker-less tracking of the hand to facilitate efficient, cost-effective and patient-friendly methods for evaluation of upper extremity motor dysfunction in different patient groups. First, the design process of the game and the system architecture of the AR framework are described. To provide unhindered assessment of motor dysfunction, patients should operate with the system in a natural way and be able to understand their actions in the virtual AR world. To test this in our system, we conducted a usability study with five healthy people (aged between 57-63) on three different modalities of visual feedback for natural hand interaction with AR objects. These modalities are: no augmented hand, partial augmented hand (tip of index finger and tip of thumb) and a full augmented hand model. The results of the study show that a virtual representation of the fingertips or hand improves the usability of natural hand interaction.},

In this paper, we propose two types of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and cameras, infrared (IR) and RGB, in order to correctly detect and identify all markers tracking objects in a given system. To detect and estimate the three-dimensional (3D) position of the marker, we measure IR LEDs using IR stereo cameras. Furthermore, in order to identify each marker, we calculate and compare the RGB color descriptor in the vicinity of its center. Our system consists of general IR and RGB cameras, and is easy to extend by increasing the number of cameras. We implemented an IR/RGB LED marker circuit and constructed a simple motion capture system to test the effectiveness of our system. The results show that our system can detect the 3D positions and unique IDs of markers in one frame.},

	Abstract = {In Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) applications, real world objects are augmented with virtual content by means of a calibrated camera-projector system. A computer generated model (CAD) of the real object is used to plan the positions where the virtual content is to be projected. It is often the case that the real object deviates from its CAD model, this resulting in misregistered augmentations. We propose a new method to dynamically correct the planned augmentation by accommodating for the unknown deviations in the object geometry. We use a closed loop approach where the projected features are detected in the camera image and deployed as feedback. As a result, the registration misalignment is identified and the augmentations are corrected in the areas affected by the deviation. Our work is especially focused on SAR applications related to the industrial domain, where this problem is omnipresent. We show that our method is effective and beneficial for multiple industrial applications.},

	Abstract = {An important yet unsolved problem in computer vision and Augmented Reality (AR) is to compute the 3D shape of nonrigid objects from live 2D videos. When the object's shape is provided in a rest pose, this is the Shape-from-Template (SfT) problem. Previous realtime SfT methods require simple, smooth templates, such as flat sheets of paper that are densely textured, and which deform in simple, smooth ways. We present a realtime SfT framework that handles generic template meshes, complex deformations and most of the difficulties present in real imaging conditions. Achieving this has required new, fast solutions to the two core sub-problems: robust registration and 3D shape inference. Registration is achieved with what we call Deformable Render-based Block Matching (DRBM): a highly-parallel solution which densely matches a time-varying render of the object to each video frame. We then combine matches from DRBM with physical deformation priors and perform shape inference, which is done by quickly solving a sparse linear system with a Geometric Multi-Grid (GMG)-based method. On a standard PC we achieve up to 21fps depending on the object. Source code will be released.},

We investigate the implications that the clients' capabilities have on the collaborative reconstruction effort and its use for AR applications.},

	Abstract = {AR systems have been developed for many years now, ranging from systems consisting of a single sensor and output device to systems with a multitude of sensors and/or output devices. With the increasing complexity of the setup, the complexity of handling the different sensors as well as the necessary calibrations and registrations increases accordingly. A much needed (yet missing) area of augmented reality applications is to support AR system engineers when they set up and maintain an AR system by providing visual guides and giving immediate feedback on the current quality of their calibration measurements. In this poster we present an approach to use Augmented Reality itself to support the user in calibrating an Augmented Reality system.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we encourage the idea of using Photogrammetric targets for object tracking in Industrial Augmented Reality (IAR). Photogrammetric targets, especially uncoded circular targets, are widely used in the industry to perform 3D surface measurements. Therefore, an AR solution based on the uncoded circular targets can improve the work flow integration by reusing existing targets and saving time. These circular targets do not have coded patterns to establish unique 2D-3D correspondences between the targets on the model and their image projections. We solve this particular problem of 2D-3D correspondence of non-coplanar circular targets from a single image. We introduce a Conic pair descriptor, which computes the Eucledian invariants from circular targets in the model space and in the image space. A three stage method is used to compare the descriptors and compute the correspondences with up to 100% precision and 89% recall rates. We are able to achieve tracking performance of 3 FPS (2560x1920 pix) to 8 FPS (640×480 pix) depending on the camera resolution and the targets present in the scene.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic spatial augmented reality requires accurate real-time 3D pose information of the physical objects that are to be projected onto. Previous depth-based methods for tracking objects required strong features to enable recognition; making it difficult to estimate an accurate 6DOF pose for physical objects with a small set of recognizable features (such as a non-textured cube). We propose a more accurate method with fewer limitations for the pose estimation of a tangible object that has known planar faces and using depth data from an RGB-D camera only. In this paper, the physical object's shape is limited to cubes of different sizes. We apply this new tracking method to achieve dynamic projections onto these cubes. In our method, 3D points from an RGB-D camera are divided into a cluster of planar regions, and the point cloud inside each face of the object is fitted to an already-known geometric model of a cube. With the 6DOF pose of the physical object, SAR generated imagery is then projected correctly onto the physical object. The 6DOF tracking is designed to support tangible interactions with the physical object. We implemented example interactive applications with one or multiple cubes to show the capability of our method.},

First, input images/videos are converted to a lower dimensional feature space, which is done to achieve effective restoration even in cases where a damaged region includes complex structures and changes in color. Second, a damaged region is restored in the converted feature space. Finally, an inverse conversion from the lower dimensional feature space to the original feature space is performed to generate the completed image in the original feature space. This three-step solution generates two advantages. First, it enhances the possibility of applying patches dissimilar to those in the original color space. Second, it enables the use of many existing restoration methods, each having various advantages, because the feature space for retrieving the similar patches is the only extension. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Even though some suggestions have already been made to address this problem, they still have shortcomings and don't provide all the required features. Thus in a first step the requirements a possible solution has to meet are collected and presented. Based on these, the augmented reality process modeling language (ARPML) is developed, which consists of the four building blocks (i) templates, (ii) sensors, (iii) work steps and (iv) tasks. In contrast to existing approaches it facilitates the creation of multiple views on a single process. This makes it possible to specifically select instructions and information needed in targeted work contexts. It also allows to combine multiple variants of one process into one model with only a minimum of redundancy. The application of ARPML is shown with a practical example.},

In this paper, we focus on manipulating the perceived surface shape of a curved object when touching it with an index finger, by visually deforming it's surface shape and displacing the visual representation of the user's index finger as like s/he is touching the deformed surface, using spatial augmented reality. Experiments were conducted with a projection system to confirm the effect of the visual feedback for manipulating the perceived shape of curved surface. The results supported the proposed concept.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a mixed-reality shopping system for users who do not own a PC but do own a tablet. In this system, while viewing panoramic images photographed along the aisles of a real store, the user can move freely around the store. Products can be selected and freely viewed from any angle. Furthermore, by utilizing a Photo-based augmented reality (Photo AR) technology the product can be displayed as if it were in the hands of the user. The results of a user evaluation showed that even though the proposed system uses a tablet with a smaller screen it was preferred over a conventional e-commerce site using a larger monitor.},

	Abstract = {Social touch such as a handshake increases the sense of coexistence and closeness between remote users in a social telepresence environment, but creating such coordinated contact movements with a distant person is extremely difficult if given only visual feedback, without haptic feedback. This paper presents a method to enable hand-contact interaction between remote users in an avatar-mediated telepresence environment. The key approach is, while the avatar directly follows its owner's motion in normal conditions, it adjusts the pose to maintain contact with the other user when the two users attempt to make contact interaction. To this end, we develop classifiers to recognize the users' intention for the contact interaction. The contact classifier identifies whether the users try to initiate contact when they are not in contact, and the separation classifier identifies whether the two in contact attempt to break contact. The classifiers are trained based on a set of geometric distance features. During the contact phase, inverse kinematics is solved to determine the pose of the avatar's arm so as to initiate and maintain natural contact with the other user's hand. Our system is unique in that two remote users can perform real time hand contact interaction in a social telepresence environment.},

	Abstract = {Usability evaluations are important to the development of augmented reality systems. However, conducting large-scale longitudinal studies remains challenging because of the lack of inexpensive but appropriate methods. In response, we propose a method for implicitly estimating usability ratings based on readily available sensor logs. To demonstrate our idea, we explored the use of features of accelerometer data in estimating usability ratings in an annotation task. Results show that our implicit method corresponds with explicit usability ratings at 79% and 84%. These results should be investigated further in other use cases, with other sensor logs.},

	Abstract = {We are investigating methods for improving the robustness and consistency of the Single Point Active Alignment Method (SPAAM) optical see-through (OST) head-mounted display (HMD) calibration procedure. Our investigation focuses on two variants of SPAAM. The first utilizes a standard monocular alignment strategy to calibrate the left and right eye separately, while the second leverages stereoscopic cues available from binocular HMDs to calibrate both eyes simultaneously. We compare results from repeated calibrations between methods using eye location estimates and inter pupillary distance (IPD) measures. Our findings indicate that the stereo SPAAM method produces more accurate and consistent results during calibration compared to the monocular variant.},

This method takes advantage of illumination over planes detected using a segmentation of the reconstructed mesh of the scene. We can also provide an estimation without suffering from the presence of specular highlights but rather use this component to refine the final estimation. This allows consistent relighting throughout the entire scene for aumented reality purposes.},

	Abstract = {We have been developing a mixed reality system to support road maintenance using overlaid visual aids. Such a system requires a positioning method that can provide sub-meter accuracy and function even if the appearance of the road surface changes significantly caused by many factors such as construction phase, time and weather. Therefore, we are developing a real-time worker positioning method that can be applied to these situation by integrating laser range finder (LRF) and pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) data. In the field, multiple workers move around the workspace. Therefore, it is necessary to determine corresponding pairs of PDR-based and LRF-based trajectories by identifying similar trajectories. In this study, we propose a method to calculate the similarity between trajectories and a procedure to integrate corresponding pairs of trajectories to acquire the position and movement direction of a worker.},

	Abstract = {The SAR technique using a projector-camera system allows us to make various effect on a real scene without physical reconstitution. In order to project contents on a textured scene without color imperfections, geometric and radiometric compensation of a projection image should be conducted as preprocessing. In this paper, we present a new geometric mapping method for color compensation in the projector-camera system. We capture the scene and segment it into adaptive patch according to the scene structure using the SLIC segmentation. The piece-wise polynomial function is evaluated for each patch to find pixel-to-pixel correspondences between the measured and projection images. Finally, color compensation is performed by using a color mixing matrix. Experimental results show that our geometric mapping method establishes accurate correspondences and color compensation alleviates the color imperfections which is caused by texture of a general scene.},

We have already been developing a web-based 3D archiving system for supporting the diverse specialties and nationalities needed for carrying out the survey and restoration work of the archaeological project. Our 3D archiving system is designed for the spontaneous updating and sharing of information on findings in order to better enable frequent discussions, through a 3D virtual copy of the field site that a user can visit, explore, and embed information into, over the Internet. Here we present an AR user interface to enhance access from mobile devices at the actual site to the archiving system. Using SFM (structure from motion) and solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem, a photo taken at the site can be stably matched to the pre-registered photo sets in the archiving system and the archived information is automatically overlaid on the photo, just in the same manner as exploring the virtual version of the site on desktop PCs. Our implementation effectively works on an on-going project in Saqqara, Egypt.},
