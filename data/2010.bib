abstract={Welcome to ISMAR 2010 in Seoul, Korea. This year's ISMAR already marks its 9th occasion and it seems that mixed and augmented reality technology has finally come of age, attracting the due attention from the general public. This is especially due to the popularity of the smart mobile devices, and thus, it is quite fitting that ISMAR is being held in Seoul, one of the most networked and dynamic place in adopting new information technology and their deployments. Especially with recent explosion of smart phones, Korea may provide a fertile ground for the wide deployment of mobile augmented reality technology on smart phones.},

abstract={At least since Sutherland's 1968 head-mounted display, augmented reality systems have inspired (and frustrated) generations of developers, users, and enthusiasts. These inspirations have led to decades of effort that yielded major innovations in technologies for 3D capture, 3D displays, tracking, and real-time image generation. Some of these component technologies, such as head-mounted displays, have proven much more difficult to bring to widespread adoption than many of us expected. Others, such as real-time image generation, have become phenomenally successful, with major societal impacts extending far beyond the initial applications. In this talk, I will describe several developments in these areas, and illustrate the resulting systems that exploited them: 1) enhancing 3D scene acquisition by laser scanning, or with structured light, or with multiple acquisition cameras; 2) augmenting a physician's view of her patient with registered internal imagery; 3) augmenting a user's surroundings with projection onto multiple nearby surfaces; 4) augmenting a user's remote presence using a human-sized avatar that mimics appearance, pose, and gestures; 5) augmenting tabletop displays with multi-user autostereoscopic capabilities. The common goal of all these systems is to enrich users' immediate surroundings with computer-generated or -controlled enhancements, which can run the gamut from mere virtual imagery to full-fledged robotic androids. I will also speculate about the possible paths to progress in the coming years. The future is encouraging, as the decreasing cost of the necessary components lowers the barriers to entry and encourages ever-increasing participation in innovation, development and use. Coupled with the rapidly advancing technologies in sensors, cameras, displays, robotics, and networks, this should enable us to accelerate bringing the visions of augmenting reality to daily life.},

year={2010},
volume={},
number={},
pages={13-17},
abstract={Visual discomfort is a major problem for head-mounted displays and other stereo displays. One effect that is known to reduce visual comfort is double vision, which can occur due to high disparities. Previous studies suggest that adding artificial out-of-focus blur increases the fusional limits, where the left and right image can be fused without double vision. We investigate the effect of adding artificial out-of-focus blur on visual discomfort using two different setups. One uses a stereo monitor and an eye tracker to change the depth of focus based on the gaze of the user. The other one uses a video-see through head mounted display. A study involving 18 subjects showed that the viewing comfort when using blur is significantly higher in both setups for virtual scenes. However we can not confirm without doubt that the higher viewing comfort is only related to an increase of the fusional limits, as many subjects reported that double vision did not occur during the experiment. Results for additional photographed images that have been shown to the subjects were less significant. A first prototype of an AR system extracting a depth map from stereo images and adding artificial out-of-focus blur is presented.},

pages={19-26},
abstract={In augmented reality displays, X-Ray visualization techniques make hidden objects visible through combining the physical view with an artificial rendering of the hidden information. An important step in X-Ray visualization is to decide which parts of the physical scene should be kept and which should be replaced by overlays. The combination should provide users with essential perceptual cues to understand the relationship of depth between hidden information and the physical scene. In this paper we present an approach that addresses this decision in unknown environments by analyzing camera images of the physical scene and using the extracted information for occlusion management. Pixels are grouped into perceptually coherent image regions and a set of parameters is determined for each region. The parameters change the X-Ray visualization for either preserving existing structures or generating synthetic structures. Finally, users can customize the overall opacity of foreground regions to adapt the visualization.},

year={2010},
volume={},
number={},
pages={27-36},
abstract={In the past, several systems have been presented that enable users to view occluded points of interest using Augmented Reality X-ray visualizations. It is challenging to design a visualization that provides correct occlusions between occluder and occluded objects while maximizing legibility. We have previously published an Augmented Reality X-ray visualization that renders edges of the occluder region over the occluded region to facilitate correct occlusions while providing foreground context. While this approach is simple and works in a wide range of situations, it provides only minimal context of the occluder object. In this paper, we present the background, design, and implementation of our novel visualization technique that aims at providing users with richer context of the occluder object. While our previous visualization only employed one salient feature (edges) to determine which parts of the occluder to display, our novel visualization technique is an initial attempt to explore the design space of employing multiple salient features for this task. The prototype presented in this paper employs three additional salient features: hue, luminosity, and motion. We have conducted two evaluations with human participants to investigate the benefits and limitations of our prototype compared to our previous system. The first evaluation showed that although our novel visualization provides a richer context of the occluder object, it does not impede users to select objects in the occluded area; but, it also indicated problems in our prototype. In the second evaluation, we have investigated these problems through an online survey with systematically varied occluder and occluded scenes, focussing on the qualitative aspects of our visualizations. The results were encouraging, but pointed out that our novel visualization needs a higher level of adaptiveness.},

year={2010},
volume={},
number={},
pages={37-45},
abstract={In many augmented reality applications, in particular in the medical and industrial domains, knowledge about tracking errors is important. Most current approaches characterize tracking errors by 6Ã6 covariance matrices that describe the uncertainty of a 6DOF pose, where the center of rotational error lies in the origin of a target coordinate system. This origin is assumed to coincide with the geometric centroid of a tracking target. In this paper, we show that, in case of a multi-camera fiducial tracking system, the geometric centroid of a body does not necessarily coincide with the point of minimum error. The latter is not fixed to a particular location, but moves, depending on the individual observations. We describe how to compute this point of minimum error given a covariance matrix and verify the validity of the approach using Monte Carlo simulations on a number of scenarios. Looking at the movement of the point of minimum error, we find that it can be located surprisingly far away from its expected position. This is further validated by an experiment using a real camera system.},

pages={47-56},
abstract={In this paper we present a direct tracking approach that uses Mutual Information (MI) as a metric for alignment. The proposed approach is robust, real-time and gives an accurate estimation of the displacement that makes it adapted to augmented reality applications. MI is a measure of the quantity of information shared by signals that has been widely used in medical applications. Since then, and although MI has the ability to perform robust alignment with illumination changes, multi-modality and partial occlusions, few works propose MI-based applications related to object tracking in image sequences due to some optimization problems. In this work, we propose an optimization method that is adapted to the MI cost function and gives a practical solution for augmented reality application. We show that by refining the computation of the Hessian matrix and using a specific optimization approach, the tracking results are far more robust and accurate than the existing solutions. A new approach is also proposed to speed up the computation of the derivatives and keep the same optimization efficiency. To validate the advantages of the proposed approach, several experiments are performed. The ESM and the proposed MI tracking approaches are compared on a standard dataset. We also show the robustness of the proposed approach on registration applications with different sensor modalities: map versus satellite images and satellite images versus airborne infrared images within different AR applications.},

abstract={We propose a novel way to augment a real scene with minimalist user intervention on a mobile phone: The user only has to point the phone camera to the desired location of the augmentation. Our method is valid for vertical or horizontal surfaces only, but this is not a restriction in practice in man-made environments, and avoids to go through any reconstruction of the 3D scene, which is still a delicate process. Our approach is inspired by recent work on perspective patch recognition and we show how to modify it for better performances on mobile phones and how to exploit the phone accelerometers to relax the need for fronto-parallel views. In addition, our implementation allows to share the augmentations and the required data over peer-to-peer communication to build a shared AR space on mobile phones.},

abstract={This paper presents folded surface detection and tracking for augmented maps. For the detection, plane detection is iteratively applied to 2D correspondences between an input image and a reference plane because the folded surface is composed of multiple planes. In order to compute the exact folding line from the detected planes, the intersection line of the planes is computed from their positional relationship. After the detection is done, each plane is individually tracked by frame-by-frame descriptor update. For a natural augmentation on the folded surface, we overlay virtual geographic data on each detected plane. The user can interact with the geographic data by finger pointing because the finger tip of the user is also detected during the tracking. As scenario of use, some interactions on the folded surface are introduced. Experimental results show the accuracy and performance of folded surface detection for evaluating the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract={The accuracy of a real time tracking system for industrial AR (IAR) applications often needs to comply with production tolerances. Such a system typically incorporates different off-/online devices so that the overall precision and accuracy cannot be trivially stated. Additionally, tracking needs to be flexible to not interfere with existing working processes and it needs to be operated and maintained free of error by on-site personnel who typically have a quality management (QM) background. For the final validation of such a complex tracking setup, empiric testing alone is either too expensive or lacks generality. This paper demonstrates a new approach to define and verify, deploy and validate, as well as to operate and maintain an IAR tracking infrastructure. We develop our concepts on the basis of an IAR application in the field of QM in the aircraft production process. It integrates a qualitative visual comparison with accurate quantitative measurements of 3D coordinates using a metrological probe. The focus is on the verification, validation, and error free operation. Monte Carlo simulation predicts the error for arbitrary system states. Using a limited set of empiric measurements in the target environment allows us to validate the simulation and thereby validate the application. This combination assures compliance of the IAR application with the required production tolerances. We show that our simulation model yields realistic results, using an in-depth analysis of an optical IR tracking system and a high-precision coordinate measurement machine capable of densely sampling the entire tracking volume. Additionally, it allows for a straightforward derivation of run-time consistency checks for the automatic identification of possible system failures. Also, estimation of the system performance during the planning and definition phases becomes possible, using the elementary accuracy specifications of the involved sensor systems.},

year={2010},
volume={},

pages={83-90},
abstract={This paper presents an instructional support system based on augmented reality (AR). This system helps a user to work intuitively by overlaying visual information in the same way of a navigation system. In usual AR systems, the contents to be overlaid onto real space are created with 3D Computer Graphics. In most cases, such contents are newly created according to applications. However, there are many 2D videos that show how to take apart or build electric appliances and PCs, how to cook, etc. Therefore, our system employs such existing 2D videos as instructional videos. By transforming an instructional video to display, according to the user's view, and by overlaying the video onto the user's view space, the proposed system intuitively provides the user with visual guidance. In order to avoid the problem that the display of the instructional video and the user's view may be visually confused, we add various visual effects to the instructional video, such as transparency and enhancement of contours. By dividing the instructional video into sections according to the operations to be carried out in order to complete a certain task, we ensure that the user can interactively move to the next step in the instructional video after a certain operation is completed. Therefore, the user can carry on with the task at his/her own pace. In the usability test, users evaluated the use of the instructional video in our system through two tasks: a task involving building blocks and an origami task. As a result, we found that a user's visibility improves when the instructional video is transformed to display according to his/her view. Further, for the evaluation of visual effects, we can classify these effects according to the task and obtain the guideline for the use of our system as an instructional support system for performing various other tasks.},

abstract={In this paper we present a novel plausible realistic rendering method for mixed reality systems, which is useful for many real life application scenarios, like architecture, product visualization or edutainment. To allow virtual objects to seamlessly blend into the real environment, the real lighting conditions and the mutual illumination effects between real and virtual objects must be considered, while maintaining interactive frame rates (20-30fps). The most important such effects are indirect illumination and shadows cast between real and virtual objects. Our approach combines Instant Radiosity and Differential Rendering. In contrast to some previous solutions, we only need to render the scene once in order to find the mutual effects of virtual and real scenes. The dynamic real illumination is derived from the image stream of a fish-eye lens camera. We describe a new method to assign virtual point lights to multiple primary light sources, which can be real or virtual. We use imperfect shadow maps for calculating illumination from virtual point lights and have significantly improved their accuracy by taking the surface normal of a shadow caster into account. Temporal coherence is exploited to reduce flickering artifacts. Our results show that the presented method highly improves the illusion in mixed reality applications and significantly diminishes the artificial look of virtual objects superimposed onto real scenes.},

abstract={Occlusion handling in augmented reality (AR) applications is challenging in synthesizing virtual objects correctly into the real scene with respect to existing foregrounds and shadows. Furthermore, outdoor environment makes the task more difficult due to the unpredictable illumination changes. This paper proposes novel outdoor illumination constraints for resolving the foreground occlusion problem in outdoor environment. The constraints can be also integrated into a probabilistic model of multiple cues for a better segmentation of the foreground. In addition, we introduce an effective method to resolve the shadow occlusion problem by using shadow detection and recasting with a spherical vision camera. We have applied the system in our digital cultural heritage project named Virtual Asuka (VA) and verified the effectiveness of the system.},

volume={},

pages={119-126},
abstract={Eye contact is believed to be an important factor in normal human communication and as a result of this a head mounted display (HMD) is often seen as something intrusive and limiting. This can be especially problematic when AR is used in a collaborative setting. The study presented in this paper aims to investigate the effects an HMD-based AR system can have on eye contact behaviour between participants in a collaborative task and thus, in extension, the effects of the HMD on collaboration itself. The focus of the study is on task-oriented collaboration between professionals. The participants worked through three different scenarios alternating between HMDs and regular paper maps with the purpose of managing the crisis response to a simulated major forest fire. Correlations between eye contact between participants and questionnaire items concerning team- and taskwork were analysed, indicating that, for the paper map condition, a high amount of eye contact is associated with low confidence and trust in the artefacts used (i.e. paper map and symbols). The amount of eye-contact in both conditions was very low. It was significantly higher for conditions without HMDs. However, the confidence and trust in the artefacts was generally rated significantly higher with HMDs than without. In conclusion, the decrease in eye contact with HMDs does not seem to have a direct effect on the collaboration in a professional, task-oriented context. This is contrary to popular assumptions and the results are relevant for future design choices for AR systems using HMDs.},

abstract={This paper discusses an experiment carried out in an AR test bed called âthe pitâ. Inspired by the well-known VR acrophobia study of Meehan et al. [18], the experimental goals were to explore whether VR presence instruments were useful in AR (and to modify them where appropriate), to compare additional measures to these well-researched techniques, and to determine if findings from VR evaluations can be transferred to AR. An experimental protocol appropriate for AR was developed. The initial experimental findings concern varying immersion factors (frame rate) and their effect on feelings of presence, user performance and behavior. Unlike the VR study, which found differing frame rates to affect presence measures, there were few differences in the five frame rate modes in our study as measured by the qualitative and quantitative instruments, which included physiological responses, a custom presence questionnaire, task performance, and user behavior. The AR presence questionnaire indicated users experienced a high feeling of presence in all frame rate modes. Behavior, performance, and interview results indicated the participants felt anxiety in the pit environment. However, the physiological data did not reflect this anxiety due to factors of user experience and experiment design. Efforts to develop a useful AR test bed and to identify results from a large data set has produced a body of knowledge related to AR evaluation that can inform others seeking to create AR experiments.},

year={2010},

pages={137-145},
abstract={The perceived depth accuracy is a fundamental performance metrics for an augmented reality display system. Many factors may affect the perceived depth of a head-mounted display (HMD), such as display resolution, interpupillary distance (IPD), conflicting depth cues, stereoacuity, and head tracking error. Besides these typical limiting factors to an HMD-type system, the perceived depth through a head-mounted projection display (HMPD) may be further affected by the usage of a retroreflective screen. In this paper, we will evaluate the perceived depth accuracy of an HMPD system using a perceptual depth matching method. The main factor to be investigated in our study is the position of a retroreflective screen relative to the projection image plane, with the projection image plane placed at different distances to the user. Overall, it is found that the ratio of the judged distance to real distance and the standard deviation of the judged distance increase linearly with the reference object distance. A transition effect from depth underestimation to overestimation has been observed at the reference object distance of around 1.4m. The position of a retroreflective screen only has a significant effect on the depth judgment error around this switching point. The paper also analyzes various effects brought by a retroreflective screen on the depth judgment. The depth cue and the image luminance reduction brought by a retroreflective screen could be the main factors that affect the depth judgment accuracy.},

pages={147-156},
abstract={This paper introduces a multi-user autostereoscopic tabletop display and its associated real-time rendering methods. Tabletop displays that support both multiple viewers and autostereoscopy have been extremely difficult to construct. Our new system is inspired by the âRandom Hole Displayâ design that modified the pattern of openings in a barrier mounted in front of a flat panel display from thin slits to a dense pattern of tiny, pseudo-randomly placed holes. This allows viewers anywhere in front of the display to see a different subset of the display's native pixels through the random-hole screen. However, a fraction of the visible pixels will be observable by more than a single viewer. Thus the main challenge is handling these âconflictingâ pixels, which ideally must show different colors to each viewer. We introduce several solutions to this problem and describe in detail the current method of choice, a combination of color blending and approximate error diffusion, performing in real time in our GPU-based implementation. The easily reproducible design uses a pattern film barrier affixed to the display by means of a transparent polycarbonate layer spacer. We use a commercial optical tracker for viewers' locations and synthesize the appropriate image (or a stereoscopic image pair) for each viewer. The system supports graceful degradation with increasing number of simultaneous views, and graceful improvement as the number of views decreases.},

Users can build their own physical world, map virtual content onto their physical construction and play directly with the surface using a stylus. A surface particle representation allows programmed content to be created independent of the display object and to be reused on many surfaces. We demonstrated this idea through a projector-camera system that acquires the object geometry and enables direct interaction through an IR tracked stylus. We present three motivating example applications, each displayed on three example surfaces. We discuss a set of interaction techniques that show possible avenues for structuring interaction on complicated everyday objects, such as Surface Adaptive GUIs for menu selection. Through a preliminary informal evaluation and interviews with end users, we demonstrate the potential of interacting with surface particles and identify improvements necessary to make this interaction practical on everyday surfaces.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for user positioning, robust tracking and online 3D mapping for outdoor augmented reality applications. As coarse user pose obtained from GPS and orientation sensors is not sufficient for augmented reality applications, sub-meter accurate user pose is then estimated by a one-step silhouette matching approach. Silhouette matching of the rendered 3D model and camera data is carried out with shape context descriptors as they are invariant to translation, scale and rotational errors, giving rise to a non-iterative registration approach. Once the user is correctly positioned, further tracking is carried out with camera data alone. Drifts associated with vision based approaches are minimized by combining different feature modalities. Robust visual tracking is maintained by fusing frame-to-frame and model-to-frame feature matches. Frame-to-frame tracking is accomplished with corner matching while edges are used for model-to-frame registration. Results from individual feature tracker are fused using a pose estimate obtained from an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a weighted M-estimator. In scenarios where dense 3D models of the environment are not available, online 3D incremental mapping and tracking is proposed to track the user in unprepared environments. Incremental mapping prepares the 3D point cloud of the outdoor environment for tracking.},

The proposed algorithm achieves the same precision as non linear optimization, getting real time performance running on commodity graphics hardware.

abstract={We propose a real-time solution for modeling and tracking multiple 3D objects in unknown environments. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we show how to scale with the number of objects. This is done by combining recent techniques for image retrieval and online Structure from Motion, which can be run in parallel. As a result, tracking 40 objects in 3D can be done within 6 to 25 milliseconds per frame, even under difficult conditions for tracking. Second, we propose a method to let the user add new objects very quickly. The user simply has to select in an image a 2D region lying on the object. A 3D primitive is then fitted to the features within this region, and adjusted to create the object 3D model. In practice, this procedure takes less than a minute.},

abstract={We present a method for estimating the 3D shape of an object from a sequence of images captured by a hand-held device. The method is well suited to augmented reality applications in that minimal user interaction is required, and the models generated are of an appropriate form. The method proceeds by segmenting the object in every image as it is captured and using the calculated silhouette to update the current shape estimate. In contrast to previous silhouette-based modelling approaches, however, the segmentation process is informed by a 3D prior based on the previous shape estimate. A voting scheme is also introduced in order to compensate for the inevitable noise in the camera position estimates. The combination of the voting scheme with the closed-loop segmentation process provides a robust and flexible shape estimation method. We demonstrate the approach on a number of scenes where segmentation without a 3D prior would be challenging.},

Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is an emerging method of displaying three-dimensional information and providing an immersive and intuitive experience with augmented reality. However, the protruding parts of displayed stereoscopic images may be blurry and cause viewing discomfort. Furthermore, the border effect may make it difficult for an imaging system to display regions next to screen borders, even with considerable negative parallax. This paper proposes a method of automatically adjusting the parallax of displayed stereo images by analyzing the feature points in regions near screen borders to produce better stereo effects. Experimental results and a subjective assessment of human factor issues indicate that the proposed method makes stereoscopic augmented reality systems significantly more attractive and comfortable to view.},

Non-photorealistic rendering creates an abstract version of both the real and virtual world by stylization to make them indistinguishable. We presented a painterly rendering algorithm for AR applications. This algorithm paints composed AR video frames with bump-mapping curly brushstrokes. Tensor fields are created for each frame to define direction for brushstrokes. The anchor point of a brushstroke is tracked or warped from frame to frame. Brushstrokes are also reshaped to provide better temporal coherence. The major difference between our algorithm and existing NPR work in general graphics and AR/VR areas is we use feature points across composed AR video frames to maintain coherence in the rendering.},

abstract={In this poster, we present an authoring tool for mixed reality (MR) contents, called k-MART. The tool is comprehensive to accommodate many different types of mixed reality applications and platforms, being able to mix and match different types of contexts and behaviors for content creation. The content is intuitively modeled as a collection of âcontext-behaviorâ pairs and saved in a declarative manner to be âplayedâ by a content browser. The tool is designed to minimize user programming and offers many abstractions of functionalities with only important details to be filled in by the user using graphical user interfaces. We believe that our approach has a good potential for the wide dissemination and sharing of MR contents.},

abstract={The creation of training applications using Augmented Reality (AR) is still a new field of research. In order to get good training results therefore evaluation should be performed. For the creation of such systems the questions arising are related to the general process of generation, visualization, evaluation and its psychological background. An important aspect of vision based AR is also the robust tracking and initialization of objects for correct augmentation. In this work we present a concept of an entire processing chain, which allows for efficient and automatic generation of such training systems that can also be used for evaluation. We do this in the context of a Lego training system. While explaining the whole process of application generation and usage, we also present a novel approach for robust marker free initialization of colored partly occluded plates and their tracking using one off the shelf monocular camera.},

abstract={There have been many studies to minimize the psychological and physical load increase caused by mobile augmented reality systems. In this paper, we propose a new technique called âEXMARâ, which enables the user to explore his/her surroundings with an expanded field of view, resulting in a decrease of physical movement. Through this novel interaction technique, the user can explore off-screen point of interests with environmental contextual information by simple dragging gestures. To evaluate this initial approach, we conducted a proof of concept usability test under a set of scenarios such as âExploring objects behind the userâ, âAvoiding the invasion of personal spaceâ and âWalk and type with front-view.â Through this initial examination, we found that users can explore off-screen point of interests and grasp the spatial relations without the increase of mental effort. We believe that this preliminary study gives a meaningful indication that employing the interactive field of view can be a useful method to decrease the physical load without any additional mental efforts in a mixed and augmented reality environment.},

abstract={For many tasks like markerless model-based camera tracking it is essential that the 3D model of a scene accurately represents the real geometry of the scene.

We present an innovative approach which is based on the insight that camera tracking can not only be used for Augmented Reality visualization but also to solve the correspondence problem between 3D measurements of a real scene and their corresponding positions in the 3D model. We combine a time-of-flight camera (which acquires depth images in real time) with a custom 2D camera (used for the camera tracking) and developed an analysis-by-synthesis approach to detect deviations between a scene and a 3D model of the scene.},

abstract={In augmented reality, marker-based tracking is the most common method for camera pose estimation. Most of the markers are black and white patterns that are visually obtrusive, but they can be hidden from the video using image inpainting methods. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approach to achieve this. We use a high-resolution hiding texture, which is captured and generated only once. To capture continuous changes in illumination, reflections and exposure, we also compute a very low-resolution texture at each frame. The coarse and fine textures are combined to obtain a detailed hiding texture which reacts to changing conditions and runs efficiently in mobile phone environments.},

abstract={Systems using two-handed spatial manipulation techniques also require strategies to enable system control tasks. These strategies make it possible to interact with the system comfortably while controlling two hand-held objects simultaneously. The Augmented Chemical Reactions project makes intense use of such two-handed interaction tasks. Users control virtual molecules and subsets that are registered to physical markers and try to combine those by selecting and then confirming a specific bond. When a desired bond has been selected, the user needs a way to confirm that bond without letting an atom go out of position. We developed and investigated two separate methods of confirming a selected bond when both hands are already doing a two-handed symmetric interaction task. The first method is a waiting method and the second method is a back&forth motion gesture. We evaluated the two methods in a user study, showing that the first technique, holding still, outperforms the other technique.},

abstract={Estimating the 3D orientation of the camera in a video sequence within a global frame of reference is useful for video stabilization when displaying the video in a virtual 3D environment, as well as for accurate navigation and other applications. This task requires the input of orientation sensors attached to the camera to provide absolute 3D orientation in a geographical frame of reference. However, high-frequency noise in the sensor readings makes it impossible to achieve accurate orientation estimates required for visually stable presentation of video sequences that were acquired with a camera subject to jitter, such as a handheld camera or a vehicle mounted camera. On the other hand, image alignment has proven successful for image stabilization, providing accurate frame-to-frame orientation estimates but drifting over time due to error and bias accumulation and lacking absolute orientation. In this paper we propose a practical method for generating high accuracy estimates of the 3D orientation of the camera within a global frame of reference by fusing orientation estimates from an efficient image-based alignment method, and the estimates from an orientation sensor, overcoming the limitations of the component methods.},

Aerial imagery can capture a wider area at once than image capturing from the ground. However, it is difficult for a user to change position and direction of viewpoint freely because of the difficulty in remote control and limitation of hardware. To overcome these problems, the proposed system uses an autopilot airship to support changing user's viewpoint and employs an omni-directional camera for changing viewing direction easily. This paper describes hardware configuration for aerial imagery, an approach for overlaying virtual objects, and automatic control of the airship, as well as experimental results using a prototype system.},

abstract={Outdoor Augmented Reality (AR) gained popularity recently due to its potential for location based mobile services. However, most commercially available Global Positioning Systems (GPS), except for the expensive high-end models, do not provide accurate location information that is enough to be used for displaying practically meaningful location based information. In this paper, we present a computer vision based method for improving user's two dimensional location and one-dimensional orientation, the initial values of which are obtained from a GPS and a digital compass. Our method utilizes corner positions of buildings in the map and the vertical edges of the buildings in the captured images. We applied anisotropic diffusion in order to filter noise and preserve edges, and dual vertical edge filters on gray and saturation images. Our method is suitable for mobile services in urban environments where tall buildings degrade GPS signals. In average, our method improved 15.0 meters in position and 2.2 degrees in orientation.},

abstract={This paper investigates the use of Spatial Augmented Reality in the prototyping of new human-machine interfaces, such as control panels or car dashboards. The prototyping system uses projectors to present the visual appearance of controls onto a mock-up of a product. Finger tracking is employed to allow real-time interactions with the controls. This technology can be used to quickly and inexpensively create and evaluate interface prototypes for devices. In the past, evaluating a prototype involved constructing a physical model of the device with working components such as buttons. We have conducted a user study to compare these two methods of prototyping and to validate the use of spatial augmented reality for rapid iterative interface prototyping. Participants of the study were required to press pairs of buttons in sequence and interaction times were measured. The results indicate that while slower, users can interact naturally with projected control panels.},

abstract={Magnetic compasses and accelerometers provide absolute orientation measurements within the earth's reference frame. However, sensor output typically suffers from jitter and external disturbances. Conversely, visual tracking provides more stable orientation estimation relative to an unknown initial orientation rather than to true north. We propose a 3-degree-of-freedom orientation tracking approach combining the accuracy and stability of vision tracking with the absolute orientation from inertial and magnetic sensors by estimating the offset between the initial orientation of the vision tracker and true north. We demonstrate that the approach improves absolute orientation estimation on a mobile phone device.},

abstract={A precise tracking with minimal setup times, minimal changes to the environment and acceptable costs, satisfying industrial demands in large factory buildings is still a challenging task for augmented reality (AR) applications. We present a system to determine the pose for monitor based AR systems in large indoor environments, e.g. 200 Ã 200 meters and more. An infrared laser detects retroreflective targets and computes a 2D position and orientation based on the information of a preprocessed map of the targets. Based on this information the 6D pose of a video camera attached to a servo motor, that is further mounted on a mobile cart is obtained by identifying the transformation between the laser scanner and the several adjustable views of the camera through a calibration method. The adjustable steps of the servo motor are limited to a discrete number of steps to limit the calibration effort. The positional accuracy of the system is estimated by error propagation and presented.},

Repeat photography is frequently used to observe and document changes in an object. Our system uses AR technology to estimate camera poses in real time. When a user takes a photo, the camera pose is saved as a âview bookmarkâ. To support a user in taking a repeat photo, two simple graphics are rendered in an AR viewer on the camera's screen to guide the user to this bookmarked view. The system then uses image adjustment techniques to create an image based on the user's repeat photo that is even closer to the original.},

abstract={Indoor tracking scenarios still face challenges in providing continuous tracking support in wide-area workplaces. This is especially the case in Augmented Reality since such augmentations generally require exact full 6DOF pose measurements in order to continuously display 3D graphics from user-related view points. Many single sensor systems have been explored but only few of them have the capability to track reliably in wide-area environments. We introduce a mobile multi-sensor platform to overcome the shortcomings of single sensor systems. The platform is equipped with a detachable optical camera and a rigidly mounted odometric measurement system providing relative positions and orientations with respect to the ground plane. The camera is used for marker-based as well as for marker-less (feature-based) inside-out tracking as part of a hybrid approach. We explain the principle tracking technologies in our competitive/cooperative fusion approach and show possible enhancements to further developments. This inside-out approach scales well with increasing tracking range, as opposed to stationary outside-in tracking.},

abstract={This paper introduces a conceptual interior design framework - Multi-Touch Mixed Reality (MTMR), which integrates mixed reality with the multi-touch tabletop interface, to provide an intuitive and efficient interface for collaborative design and an augmented 3D view to users at the same time. Under this framework, multiple designers can carry out design work simultaneously on the top view displayed on the tabletop, while live video of the ongoing design work is captured and augmented by overlaying virtual 3D furniture models to their 2D virtual counterparts, and shown on a vertical screen in front of the tabletop. Meanwhile, the remote client's camera view of the physical room is augmented with the interior design layout in real time, that is, as the designers place, move, and modify the virtual furniture models on the tabletop, the client sees the corresponding life-size 3D virtual furniture models residing, moving, and changing in the physical room through the camera view on his/her screen. By adopting MTMR, which we argue may also apply to other kinds of collaborative work, the designers can expect a good working experience in terms of naturalness and intuitiveness, while the client can be involved in the design process and view the design result without moving around heavy furniture. By presenting MTMR, we hope to provide reliable and precise freehand interactions to mixed reality systems, with multi-touch inputs on tabletop interfaces.},

abstract={Building tall structures behind an aesthetic and historical building tends to destroy the good landscape. To avoid such situations, public agencies must regulate height of buildings and other structures near the landscape target. In order to check the visibility of portions of high, future structures, in this research, a new method using Augmented Reality (AR) was proposed. In this method, a number of virtual rectangular objects with a scale are located on the grid of 3D geographical model. And then, the virtual rulers are shown in an overlapping manner with the actual landscape from multiple viewpoints using the AR technology. The user measures the maximum skyline-preserving height for each rectangular object at a grid point. Using the measured data, the government or public agencies can establish appropriate height regulations for all surrounding areas of the target structures. To verify the proposed method, a system was developed deploying AR Toolkit and was applied to a scenic building. The performance of the system was checked and then, the errors of the obtained data were evaluated. In conclusion, the proposed method was evaluated feasible and effective.},

abstract={To insert a virtual object into a real image, the position of the object must appear seamlessly as the camera moves. This requires camera tracking with estimations of all internal and external parameters in each frame with an adequate degree of stability to ensure negligible visible drift between the real and virtual elements. In the post production of film, matchmoving software based on SfM is typically used in the camera tracking process. However, most of this type of software fails when attempting to track the camera in a dynamic scene in which a moving foreground object such as a real actor occupies a large part of the background. Therefore, this study proposes a camera tracking system that uses an auxiliary camera to estimate the motion of the main shooting camera and 3D position of background features in a dynamic scene. A novel reconstruction and connection method was developed for feature tracks that are occluded by a foreground object. Experimentation with a 2K sequence demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method.},

abstract={We demonstrate a visual recognition system operating on a hand-held device, with the help of an efficient and robust feature tracking and an object recognition mechanism that can be used for interactive mobile applications. In our recognition system, corner features are detected from captured video frames in a multi-scale image pyramid, and are tracked between consecutive frames efficiently. In order to perform object recognition, local descriptors are calculated on the tracked features, and quantized using a vocabulary tree. For each object, a bag-of-words model is learned from multiple views. The learned objects are recognized by computing the ranking score for the set of features in a single video frame. Our feature tracking algorithm and local descriptors are different than the Lucas-Kanade algorithm in image pyramid or the SIFT descriptor, however improving the efficiency and accuracy. For our implementation on a mobile phone, we used an iPhone 3GS with a 600MHz ARM chip CPU. The video frame is captured from a camera preview screen at a rate of 15 frames per second using the public API. The task of object recognition on a mobile phone runs at around 7 frames per second, including the feature tracking and descriptor calculation.},

abstract={This demonstration presents folded surface detection and tracking for augmented maps. We model the folded surface as multiple planes. To detect a folded surface, plane detection is iteratively applied to 2D correspondences between an input image and a reference plane. In order to compute the exact folding line from the detected planes, the intersection line of the planes is computed from their positional relationship. After the detection is done, each plane is individually tracked by frame-by-frame descriptor update. For a natural augmentation on the folded surface, we overlay virtual geographic data on each detected plane.},

abstract={We present an architecture [fig. 1] and runtime environment for mobile Augmented Reality applications. The architecture is based on a plugin-concept on the device, a set of basic functionalities available for all apps and a cloud-oriented processing approach. As a first running sample app, we show a face recognition service running on a mobile phone, conventional wearable displays and upcoming see-through-goggles. We invite interested 3rd parties to try out the environment, face recognition app and platform.},
