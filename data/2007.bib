abstract={We present a system that employs a custom-built pan-tilt-zoom camera for laser pointer tracking in arbitrary real environments. Once placed in a room, it carries out a fully automatic self-registration, registrations of projectors, and sampling of surface parameters, such as geometry and reflectivity. After these steps, it can be used for tracking a laser spot on the surface as well as an LED marker in 3D space, using inter-playing fish-eye context and controllable detail cameras. The captured surface information can be used for masking out areas that are problematic for laser pointer tracking, and for guiding geometric and radiometric image correction techniques that enable a projector-based augmentation on arbitrary surfaces. We describe a distributed software framework that couples laser pointer tracking for interaction, projector-based AR as well as video see-through AR for visualizations, with the domain specific functionality of existing desktop tools for architectural planning, simulation and building surveying.},

abstract={Over the past years, a variety of augmented reality (AR)-based applications were created, to support industrial processes. Although these first demonstrator applications or prototypes cover all parts of the industrial product process (design, planning and production, service and maintenance), only a few of them actually turned into established and applied solutions. In the automotive industry, one successful field for AR-based applications is factory design and planning, metaio and Volkswagen Group Research have concerted their research work to continuously enhance a first prototype in order to create a serviceable and accepted software tool, which is tailored to the needs of AR-based factory planning processes. This paper presents the developing process of this application, the requirements analysis and the realization as a complete system.

Users can play the tabletop game as if their opponent were sitting across from the table, despite being physically separated. By detecting and sending the status of each real game board to the other site, both users feel that they are sharing tabletop objects.},

abstract={Tangible augmented reality (AR) systems imbue physical objects with the ability to act and respond in new ways. In particular, physical objects and gestures made with them gain meaning that does not exist outside the tangible AR environment. The existence of this new set of possible actions and outcomes is not always apparent, making it necessary to learn new movements or gestures. Addressing this opportunity, we present visual hints, which are graphical representations in AR of potential actions and their consequences in the augmented physical world. Visual hints enable discovery, learning, and completion of gestures and manipulation in tangible AR. Here, we discuss our investigation of a variety of representations of visual hints and methods for activating them. We then describe a specific implementation that supports gestures developed for a tangible AR user interface to an electronic field guide for botanists, and present results from a pilot study.},

abstract={We introduce AR-Jig, a new handheld tangible user interface for 3D digital modeling in augmented reality (AR) space. AR-Jig has a pin array that displays a 2D physical curve coincident with a contour of a digitally displayed 3D form. It supports physical interaction with a portion of a 3D digital representation, allowing 3D forms to be directly touched and modified. Traditional tangible user interfaces physically embody all the data; in contrast, this project leaves the majority of the data in the digital domain but gives physicality to any portion of the larger digital dataset via a handheld tool. This tangible intersection enables the flexible manipulation of digital artifacts, both physically and virtually. Through an informal test by end-users and interviews with professionals, we confirmed the potential of the AR-Jig concept while identifying the improvements necessary to make AR-Jig a practical tool for 3D digital design.},

abstract={Unknown environments pose a particular challenge for augmented reality applications because the 3D models required for tracking, rendering and interaction are not available ahead of time. Consequently, authoring of AR content must take place on-line. This work describes a set of techniques to simplify the online authoring of annotations in unknown environments using a simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) system. The point-based SLAM system is extended to specifically track and estimate high-level features indicated by the user. The automatic estimation of these complex landmarks by the system relieves the user from the burden of manually specifying the full 3D pose of annotations while improving accuracy. These properties are especially interesting for remote collaboration applications where either user interfaces on handhelds or camera control by the remote expert are limited.},

abstract={We present a solution for automatic extraction of contour models out of polygonal CAD models. Such contour models can be used for markerless initialization and tracking purposes. To create a contour model we synthesize different views of the object using its CAD model. During the view generation we alternate the camera pose as well as light conditions in order to extract the most stable contours in terms of illumination invariance and view independence. We project the extracted 2D edges back into the 3D space and accumulate for every 3D point statistics over different views describing its visibility and stability under different illumination conditions. After filtering out all 3D points with probability below a certain threshold value we use the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to get the connected contours out of the 3D point cloud. The result is a B-Spline or VRML representation of the most stable contours.},

abstract={Many of the robust visual tracking techniques utilized by augmented reality applications rely on 3D models and information extracted from images. Models enhanced with image information make it possible to initialize tracking and detect poor registration. Unfortunately, generating 3D CAD models and registering them to image information can be a time consuming operation. Regularly the process requires multiple trips between the site being modeled and the workstation used to create the model. The system presented in this work eliminates the need for a separately generated 3D model by utilizing modern structure-from-motion techniques to extract the model and associated image information directly from an image sequence. The technique can be implemented on any handheld device instrumented with a camera and network connection. The process of creating the model requires minimal user interaction in the form of a few cues to identify planar regions on the object of interest. In addition the system selects a set of keyframes for each region to capture viewpoint based appearance changes. This work also presents a robust tracking framework to take advantage of these new edge models. Performance of both the modeling technique and the tracking system are verified on several different objects.},

abstract={Most car accidents occur due to longitudinal collisions or lane departure. We assume that the number of such accidents can be reduced, if the driver knows more precisely, where the car is heading and at which distance it can stop. To provide drivers with this kind of anticipation, we have developed two augmented reality based visualization schemes for longitudinal and lateral driver assistance in the head-up display (HUD) of cars. One presentation scheme indicates the braking distance by a virtual bar on the road. The second scheme adds the visualization of a drive-path between the car and the bar, zoning the entire region that the car will pass before coming to a complete halt. We have tested both schemes in a driving simulator in comparison to a baseline without visual assistance. Our results show, among other findings, that the bar is preferred, that it supports driving performance and that it does not increase mental workload.},

abstract={This paper evaluates different display devices for selection or annotation tasks in augmented reality (AR). We compare three different display types - a head mounted display and two hand held displays. The first hand held display is configured as a magic lens where the user sees the augmented space directly behind the display. The second hand held display is configured to be used at waist level (as one would commonly hold a tablet computer) but the view is still of the scene in front of the user. Making a selection or annotation in AR requires two distinct tasks by the user. First, the user must find the real (or virtual) object they want to mark. Second, the user must move a cursor to the object's location. We test and compare our three representative displays with respect to both tasks. We found that using a hand held display in the magic lens configuration was faster for cursor movement than either of the other two displays. There was no significant difference among the displays regarding the amount of time it took users to search for either physical or virtual objects.},

abstract={An ongoing research problem in Augmented Reality (AR) is to improve tracking and display technology in order to minimize registration errors. However, perfect registration is not always necessary for users to understand the intent of an augmentation. This paper describes the results of an experiment to evaluate the effects of registration error in a Lego block placement task and the effectiveness of graphical context at ameliorating these effects. Three types of registration error were compared: no error, fixed error and random error. These three errors were evaluated with no context present and some graphical context present. The results of this experiment indicated that adding graphical context to a scene in which some registration error is present can allow a person to effectively operate in such an environment, in this case completing the Lego block placement task with a reduced number of errors made and in a shorter amount of time.},

year={2007},
volume={},

pages={111-115},
abstract={Construction companies employ CAD software during the planning phase, but what is finally built often does not match the original plan. The procedure of validating the model is called "discrepancy check". The system proposed here allows the user to easily obtain an augmentation in order to find differences between the planned 3D model and the built items. The main difference to previous body of work in this field is the emphasis on usability and acceptance of the solution. While standard image-based solutions use markers or rely on a "perfect" 3D model to find the pose of the camera, our software uses anchor-plates. Anchor-Plates are rectangular structures installed on walls and ceiling in the majority of industrial edifices. We are using them as landmarks because they are the most reliable components often used as reference coordinates by constructors. Furthermore, for real industrial applications, they are the most suitable solutions in terms of general applicability. Unfortunately, they have not been designed with computer vision applications in mind. On the contrary, they are often made or painted in such way that they are not easily popping out. They are therefore difficult targets to segment and to track. This paper proposes a solution to extract and match them to their 3D counterparts. We created a software that uses the detected structures for pose estimation and image augmentation. The software has been successfully employed to find discrepancies in several rooms of two industrial plants.},

Such sensor systems are the foundation of future safety systems, such as automatic emergency brakes, as well as for interactive driver assistance systems. We have developed a system that can visualize such spatial sensor data. Two environments are supported: a laboratory setup for off-line experience and a car setup that enables live experience of spatially aligned laser scanner and video data in real traffic. We have used two visualization devices, a video see-through LCD flat panel (TFT) and an optical see-through head-mounted display (HMD) in both setups. For the laboratory setup, a back-projection table has been integrated as well. To present data in correct spatial alignment, we have installed tracking systems in both environments. Visualization schemes for spatial sensor data and for geometric models that outline recognized objects have been developed. We report on our system and discuss experiences from the development and realization phases. The system is not intended to be used as a component of real driver assistance systems. Rather, it can bridge the gap between human machine interface (HMI) designers and sensing engineers during the development phase. Furthermore, it can be both a debugging tool for the realization of environmental perception systems and an experimental platform for the design of presentation schemes for upcoming driver assistance systems.},

abstract={In this paper we present the evaluation of a virtual mirror used as a navigational tool within a medical augmented reality (AR) system for laparoscopy. 12 surgeons of our clinical partner participated in an experiment to evaluate whether laparoscope augmentation extended by a virtual mirror is useful for improved perception of complex structures. Such complex structures are encountered for instance in laparoscopic resection of tumor affected liver tissue. The blood vessels supplying the tumor have to be cut and closed before tumorous tissue can be removed. A laparoscopic camera and an optical tracking system allow for the visualization of visualized medical volumetric data registered with the real anatomy. Previously injected contrast agent provides an accentuation of blood vessels within the visualization. For evaluating the suitability of a virtual mirror to support the mentioned procedure, we designed a phantom consisting of wooden branches simulating the structure of blood vessel trees. Quantitative results of the experiment show the advantage of a mirror in certain cases, when blood vessels cannot be directly seen from the camera point of view due to self-occlusion of the structure. Results of a questionnaire filled out by the surgeons after the experiments confirm the acceptance of AR technology for particular medical procedures.},

abstract={The need to improve medical diagnosis and reduce invasive surgery is dependent upon seeing into a living human system. The use of diverse types of medical imaging and endoscopic instruments has provided significant breakthroughs, but not without limiting the surgeon's natural, intuitive and direct 3D perception into the human body. This paper presents a method for the use of augmented reality (AR) for the convergence of improved perception of 3D medical imaging data (mimesis) in context to the patient's own anatomy (in-situ) incorporating the physician's intuitive multi- sensory interaction and integrating direct manipulation with endoscopic instruments. Transparency of the video images recorded by the color cameras of a video see-through, stereoscopic head- mounted-display (HMD) is adjusted according to the position and line of sight of the observer, the shape of the patient's skin and the location of the instrument. The modified video image of the real scene is then blended with the previously rendered virtual anatomy.

abstract={We present an efficient and accurate object tracking algorithm based on the concept of graph cut segmentation. The ability to track visible objects in real-time provides an invaluable tool for the implementation of markerless Augmented Reality. Once an object has been detected, it's location in future frames can be used to position virtual content, and thus annotate the environment. Unlike many object tracking algorithms, our approach does not rely on a preexisting 3D model or any other information about the object or its environment. It takes, as input, a set of pixels representing an object in an initial frame and uses a combination of optical flow and graph cut segmentation to determine the corresponding pixels in each future frame. Experiments show that our algorithm robustly tracks objects of disparate shapes and sizes over hundreds of frames, and can even handle difficult cases where an object contains many of the same colors as its background. We further show how this technology can be applied to practical AR applications.},

abstract={Most work in visual augmented reality (AR) employs predefined markers or models that simplify the algorithms needed for sensor positioning and augmentation but at the cost of imposing restrictions on the areas of operation and on interactivity. This paper presents a simple game in which an AR agent has to navigate using real planar surfaces on objects that are dynamically added to an unprepared environment. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) framework with automatic plane discovery is used to enable the player to interactively build a structured map of the game environment using a single, agile camera. By using SLAM, we are able to achieve real-time interactivity and maintain rigorous estimates of the system's uncertainty, which enables the effects of high quality estimates to be propagated to other features (points and planes) even if they are outside the camera's current field of view.},

abstract={Many augmented reality (AR) applications use marker-based vision tracking systems to recover camera pose by detecting one or more planar landmarks. However, most of these systems do not interactively quantify the accuracy of the pose they calculate. Instead, the accuracy of these systems is either ignored, assumed to be a fixed value, or determined using error tables (constructed in an off-line ground-truthed process) along with a run-time interpolation scheme. The validity of these approaches are questionable as errors are strongly dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters and scene geometry. In this paper we present an algorithm for predicting the statistics of marker tracker error in real-time. Based on the scaled spherical simplex unscented transform (SSSUT), the algorithm is applied to the augmented reality toolkit plus (ARToolKitPlus). The results are validated using precision off-line photogrammetric techniques.},

abstract={Outdoor augmented reality systems often rely on GPS to cover large environments. Visual tracking approaches can provide more accurate location estimates but typically require a manual initialisation procedure. This paper describes the combination of both techniques to create an accurate localisation system that does not require any additional input for (re-)initialisation. The 2D GPS position together with average user height is used as an initial estimate for the visual tracking. The large gap in available GPS accuracy versus required accuracy for initialisation is overcome through a search procedure that tries to minimise search time by improving the likelihood of finding the correct estimate early. Re-initialisation of the visual tracking system after catastrophic failures is further improved by modelling the GPS error with a Gaussian process to provide a better estimate of the current location, thereby decreasing search time.},

Mic-Through AR allows audio signals captured from ear-worn microphones to be mixed with computer-generated audio in the computer, and delivered to the user over headphones. We present preliminary results from an empirical user study conducted to compare a bone-conduction device, headphones, and a speaker array. The results show that subjects achieved the best accuracy using an array of speakers physically located around the listener when stationary sounds were played, but that there was no difference in accuracy between the speaker array and the bone-conduction device for sounds that were moving, and that both devices outperformed standard headphones for moving sounds.},

abstract={The development of a wide field-of-view (FOV) head mounted display (HMD) has been a technological challenge for decades. Previous HMDs tackled this problem using multiple display units (tiling) or multiple curved mirrors. The former approach tends to be expensive and heavy, whereas the latter approach tends to suffer from image distortion and a small exit pupil. In order to provide a wide FOV image with a large exit pupil, the present paper proposes a novel head mounted projective display (HMPD) using a hyperbolic half-silvered mirror, rather than a conventional planar mirror.

The server's decisions are inferred from an actively maintained central spatial relationship graph (SRG) using spatial relationship patterns. The system is compared to a previous Ubitrack implementation using the highly distributed DWARF middleware. It exhibits significantly better performance in a reference scenario.},

abstract={Latency is a key property of video see through AR systems since users' performance is strongly related to it. However, there is no standard way of latency measurement of an AR system in the literature. We have created a stable and comparable way of estimating the latency in a video see through AR system. The latency is estimated by encoding the time in the image and decoding the time after camera feedback. We have encoded the time as a translation of a circle in the image. The cross ratio has been used as an image feature that is preserved in a projective transformation. The encoding allows for a simple but accurate way of decoding. We show that this way of encoding has an adequate accuracy for latency measurements. As the method allows for a series of automatic measurements we propose to visualize the measurements in a histogram. This histogram reveals meaningful information about the system other than the mean value and standard deviation of the latency. The method has been tested on four different AR systems that use different camera technology, resolution and frame rates.},

A small and inexpensive camera used in augmented reality systems sometimes captures degraded images because its focus and/or iris are fixed.

The proposed method improves the accuracy of the estimated camera position and posture by estimating blur effects from the captured image, and by correcting the detected positions of feature points through the results. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed through experiments of corner estimation from simulated images and extrinsic camera parameter estimation from real images.},

This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

Two dimensional deformation estimation in the presence of self-occlusions is very challenging. This paper proposes a specific framework explicitly modeling self-occlusions for augmented reality applications. The basic idea is to detect self-occlusions as warp shrinkage areas. Deformations are initially estimated via direct non-rigid image registration. Temporal smoothness is then used to refine the warps and the image are augmented. Experimental results on several challenging datasets show that our approach convincingly augments self-occluded surfaces. Associated videos are available on the first author's Web homepage.},

In this method, possible azimuths of the camera pose are hypothesized by a voting method under an inclination constraint. Then some camera positions for each possible azimuth are calculated based on the detected line segments that affirmatively voted for the azimuth. Finally, the most consistent one is selected as the camera pose out of the multiple sets of the camera positions and azimuths. Unlike many other tracking methods, our method does not use past information but rather estimates the camera pose using only present information. This feature is useful for an initialization measure of registration in augmented reality (AR) systems.

abstract={Webtag is a marker based system where every marker contains an internationally unique identifier which links to 2D or 3D content from a user's Website. A two stage design combines the basic 10-bit ID (tier-1 ID) of the current ARTag system which is used for pose tracking when the marker is far away, and a smaller and dense array of extra bits allow an additional 32 bits (tier-2 ID) to be recognized when the camera is close. A user brings his/her AR device close to the marker such that the tier-2 ID is read, and then the IDs are mapped to a web address from which the augmenting model, image, or animation is loaded. Thereafter the content is rendered relative to the tier-1 ID which can be seen at greater distances. This allows a user anywhere on internet to access augmented content printed in magazines, seen on posters, etc. Webtag is a prototype system that may allow large scale acceptance of AR by the public.},

pages={265-266},
abstract={In this paper, we have addressed the usability issue of augmented reality systems. In order to overcome the lack of view into the interaction space in nominal AR systems, we proposed to create and use a mosaiced image as a cost effective and practical solution. One of the obvious problem is that even if the view span is increased by the mosaicing, because of the fixed and limited resolution/size of the display(either HMD or upright display), the content must be viewed in smaller scale. Yang et al. has found out that increasing the geometric field of view can be tolerated to some degree without much degradation in task performance [3]. In our pilot experiment, a comparison of our mosaiced AR display to the nominal set up improved task performance when the task involved manipulation of many tangible props in a relatively wide area. Our future work is to conduct a more formal usability study and address other AR usability issues.},

abstract={3D graphics systems increasingly rely on sophisticated event systems derived from collision detection mechanisms, which support the discretisation of Physics as well as high-level programming and scripting. By contrast, augmented reality systems have not yet adopted this approach. We describe the development of a high-level event system on top of the ARToolkit environment incorporating the ODE Physics engine. We first define a typology of events encompassing interactions between virtual objects as well as interactions involving markers. We then describe how these events can be recognised in real-time from elementary collisions detected by the ODE Physics engine. We conclude by discussing examples of high-level event recognitions and how they can support the development of applications.},

The shapes of the physical objects are reconfigurable by assembling different parts to the main body of the mock-up. Augmented reality technologies were used to alter the appearance of the mock-up by rendering the 3D models, colors, and interfaces accordingly. Developed AR-based reconfigurable mock-up is expected to be used for realistic design evaluation and CEO presentations.},

abstract={One of the problems in developing a humanoid robot is caused by the fact that intermediate results, such as what the robot perceives the environment, and how it plans its moving path are hard to be observed online in the physical environment. What developers can see is only the behavior. Therefore, they usually investigate logged data afterwards, to analyze how well each component worked, or which component was wrong in the total system. In this paper, we present a novel environment for robot development, in which intermediate results of the system are overlaid on physical space using mixed reality technology. Real-time observation enables the developers to see intuitively, in what situation the specific intermediate results are generated, and to understand how results of a component affected the total system. This feature makes the development efficient and precise. This environment also gives a human-robot interface that shows the robot internal state intuitively, not only in development, but also in operation.},

abstract={Since the last ten years product development in automotive industry is changing radically. Most physical mock-ups have vanished and are now replaced by digital ones. But they are still needed for final evaluations or issues, which cannot be adequately simulated. During their production, deviations from the CAD model may be made. Since digital and real mock-up must match for the further product development, the transfer of differences between physical and digital mock-up to the CAD format is a crucial issue. In this paper an augmented reality (AR) based tool-chain is presented, which allows matching the CAD data with real mock-ups and documents the differences between them. Essential functions like measurement and online construction are provided, allowing the end-users to create information in AR space and feeding them back into the CAD model.},

abstract={This paper proposes a framework named TIPMR, for designing tangible user interfaces (TUIs) within projector-based mixed reality applications. The framework divides the target application into three parts: GUI-based application, TUI and an assistant. The assistant is employed as an adapter to translate between TUI operations and general GUI commands like mouse or keyboard events. This architecture makes it easier to focus on designing GUI-based applications and TUI separately. We built a tourist guidance system with two different tangible interaction modes based on TIPMR to demonstrate its usefulness and efficiency.},

We implement several improvements to the basic algorithm that significantly improve its performance and reduce its memory footprint making the use of this algorithm on the mobile phone practical. Our prototype implementation has been applied to several practical applications such as image search, object recognition and augmented reality applications.},
