abstract={Diminished reality (DR) enables us to see through real objects occluding some areas in our field of view. This interactive display has various applications, such as see-through vision to visualize invisible areas, work area visualization in surgery and landscape simulation. In this paper, we propose two underlying problems in see-through vision, in which hidden areas are observed in real time. First, see-through vision methods require a common area to calibrate every camera in the environment. However, the field of view is limited and many approaches rely on a time-consuming calibration, sensors, or fiducial markers. Second, see-through vision applications assume that the background is planar to ease image alignment. We therefore present a place-and-play see-through vision system using a wide field-of-view RGB-D camera. We validated the accuracy and the robustness of our system and showed results in various environments to show the applicability.},
