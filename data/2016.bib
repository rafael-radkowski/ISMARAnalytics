year={2016},
volume={},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Keyframe-based SLAM has achieved great success in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability. However, due to parallax requirement and delay of map expansion, traditional keyframe-based methods easily encounter the robustness problem in the challenging cases especially for fast motion with strong rotation. For AR applications in practice, these challenging cases are easily encountered, since a home user may not carefully move the camera to avoid potential problems. With the above motivation, in this paper, we present RKSLAM, a robust keyframe-based monocular SLAM system that can reliably handle fast motion and strong rotation, ensuring good AR experiences. First, we propose a novel multihomography based feature tracking method which is robust and efficient for fast motion and strong rotation. Based on it, we propose a real-time local map expansion scheme to triangulate the observed 3D points immediately without delay. A sliding-window based camera pose optimization framework is proposed, which imposes the motion prior constraints between consecutive frames through simulated or real IMU data. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods, and an AR application on mobile devices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={11-17},
abstract={We present an approach to estimate absolute scale in handheld monocular SLAM by simultaneously tracking the user's face with a user-facing camera while a world-facing camera captures the scene for localization and mapping. Given face tracking at absolute scale, two images of a face taken from two different viewpoints enable estimating the translational distance between the two viewpoints in absolute units, such as millimeters. Under the assumption that the face itself stayed stationary in the scene while taking the two images, the motion of the user-facing camera relative to the face can be transferred to the motion of the rigidly connected world-facing camera relative to the scene. This allows determining also the latter motion in absolute units and enables reconstructing and tracking the scene at absolute scale.As faces of different adult humans differ only moderately in terms of size, it is possible to rely on statistics for guessing the absolute dimensions of a face. For improved accuracy the dimensions of the particular face of the user can be calibrated.Based on sequences of world-facing and user-facing images captured by a mobile phone, we show for different scenes how our approach enables reconstruction and tracking at absolute scale using a proof-of-concept implementation. Quantitative evaluations against ground truth data confirm that our approach provides absolute scale at an accuracy well suited for different applications. Particularly, we show how our method enables various use cases in handheld Augmented Reality applications that superimpose virtual objects at absolute scale or feature interactive distance measurements.},

pages={18-26},
abstract={In this paper we propose a novel method called s-DVO for dense visual odometry using a probabilistic sensor noise model. In contrast to sparse visual odometry, where camera poses are estimated based on matched visual features, we apply dense visual odometry which makes full use of all pixel information from an RGB-D camera. Previously, t-distribution was used to model photometric and geometric errors in order to reduce the impacts of outliers in the optimization. However, this approach has the limitation that it only uses the error value to determine outliers without considering the physical process. Therefore, we propose to apply a probabilistic sensor noise model to weigh each pixel by propagating linearized uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that the geometric errors are well represented with the sensor noise model, while the photometric errors are not. Finally we propose a hybrid approach which combines t-distribution for photometric errors and a probabilistic sensor noise model for geometric errors. We extend the dense visual odometry and develop a visual SLAM system that incorporates keyframe generation, loop constraint detection and graph optimization. Experimental results with standard benchmark datasets show that our algorithm outperforms previous methods by about a 25% reduction in the absolute trajectory error.},

abstract={We present a method for recovering both incident lighting and surface materials from casually scanned geometry. By casual, we mean a rapid and potentially noisy scanning procedure of unmodified and uninstrumented scenes with a commodity RGB-D sensor. In other words, unlike reconstruction procedures which require careful preparations in a laboratory environment, our method works with input that can be obtained by consumer users. To ensure a robust procedure, we segment the reconstructed geometry into surfaces with homogeneous material properties and compute the radiance transfer on these segments. With this input, we solve the inverse rendering problem of factorization into lighting and material properties using an iterative optimization in spherical harmonics form. This allows us to account for self-shadowing and recover specular properties. The resulting data can be used to generate a wide range of mixed reality applications, including the rendering of synthetic objects with matching lighting into a given scene, but also re-rendering the scene (or a part of it) with new lighting. We show the robustness of our approach with real and synthetic examples under a variety of lighting conditions and compare them with ground truth data.},

abstract={Proper scene inference provides the basis for a seamless integration of virtual objects into the real environment. While widely neglected in many AR/MR environments, previous approaches providing good results were based on rather complex setups, often involving mirrored balls, several HDR cameras, and fish eye lenses to achieve proper light probes. In this paper we present an approach requiring a single RGB-D camera image only for generating glossy reflections on virtual objects. Our approach is based on a partial 3D reconstruction of the real environment combined with a screen-space ray-tracing mechanism. We show that our approach allows for convincing reflections of the real environment as well as mutual reflections between virtual objects of an MR environment.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={44-53},
abstract={Specularities, which are often visible in images, may be problematic in computer vision since they depend on parameters which are difficult to estimate in practice. We present an empirical model called JOLIMAS: JOint LIght-MAterial Specularity, which allows specularity prediction. JOLIMAS is reconstructed from images of specular reflections observed on a planar surface and implicitly includes light and material properties which are intrinsic to specularities. This work was motivated by the observation that specularities have a conic shape on planar surfaces. A theoretical study on the well known illumination models of Phong and Blinn-Phong was conducted to support the accuracy of this hypothesis. A conic shape is obtained by projecting a quadric on a planar surface. We showed empirically the existence of a fixed quadric whose perspective projection fits the conic shaped specularity in the associated image. JOLIMAS predicts the complex phenomenon of specularity using a simple geometric approach with static parameters on the object material and on the light source shape. It is adapted to indoor light sources such as light bulbs or fluorescent lamps. The performance of the prediction was convincing on synthetic and real sequences. Additionally, we used the specularity prediction for dynamic retexturing and obtained convincing rendering results. Further results are presented as supplementary material.},

abstract={Dynamic occlusion handling is critical for correct depth perception in Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Consequently it is a key component to ensure realistic and immersive AR experiences. Existing solutions to tackle this challenge typically suffer from various limitations, e.g. assumption of a static scene or high computational complexity. In this work, we propose an algorithm for depth map enhancement for dynamic occlusion handling in AR applications. The key of our algorithm is an edge snapping approach, formulated as discrete optimization, that improves the consistency of object boundaries between RGB and depth data. The optimization problem is solved efficiently via dynamic programming and our system runs in near real-time on the tablet platform. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach largely improves the raw sensor data and is particularly suitable compared to several related approaches in terms of both speed and quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate visually pleasing dynamic occlusion effects for multiple AR use cases based on our edge snapping results.},

The user only needs a small calibration board to calibrate the system regardless of the focus distance of the projector. Results show that the root-mean-squared re-projection error (RMSE) for a 450cm projection distance is only about 4mm, even though it is calibrated using a small B4 (250Ã—353mm) calibration board.},

abstract={Camera pose estimation is the cornerstone of Augmented Reality applications. Pose tracking based on camera images exclusively has been shown to be sensitive to motion blur, occlusions, and illumination changes. Thus, a lot of work has been conducted over the last years on visual-inertial pose tracking using acceleration and angular velocity measurements from inertial sensors in order to improve the visual tracking. Most proposed systems use statistical filtering techniques to approach the sensor fusion problem, that require complex system modelling and calibrations in order to perform adequately. In this work we present a novel approach to sensor fusion using a deep learning method to learn the relation between camera poses and inertial sensor measurements. A long short-term memory model (LSTM) is trained to provide an estimate of the current pose based on previous poses and inertial measurements. This estimates then appropriately combined with the output of a visual tracking system using a linear Kalman Filter to provide a robust final pose estimate. Our experimental results confirm the applicability and tracking performance improvement gained from the proposed sensor fusion system.},

abstract={This article presents an analysis into the accuracy and problems of freehand grasping in exocentric Mixed Reality (MR). We report on two experiments (1710 grasps) which quantify the influence different virtual object shape, size and position has on the most common physical grasp, a medium wrap. We propose two methods for grasp measurement, namely, the Grasp Aperture (GAp) and Grasp Displacement (GDisp). Controlled laboratory conditions are used where 30 right-handed participants attempt to recreate a medium wrap grasp. We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the results giving pairwise comparisons of all conditions under test. The results illustrate that user Grasp Aperture varies less than expected in comparison to the variation of virtual object size, with common aperture sizes found. Regarding the position of the virtual object, depth estimation is often mismatched due to under judgement of the z position and x, y displacement has common patterns. Results from this work can be applied to aid in the development of freehand grasping and considered as the first study into accuracy of freehand grasping in MR, provide a starting point for future interaction design.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={94-99},
abstract={Properly calibrating an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD) and maintaining a consistent calibration over time can be a very challenging task. Automated methods need an accurate model of both the OST-HMD screen and the user's constantly changing eye-position to correctly project virtual information. While some automated methods exist, they often have restrictions, including fixed eye-cameras that cannot be adjusted for different users.To address this problem, we have developed a method that automatically determines the position of an adjustable eye-tracking camera and its unconstrained position relative to the display. Unlike methods that require a fixed pose between the HMD and eye camera, our framework allows for automatic calibration even after adjustments of the camera to a particular individual's eye and even after the HMD moves on the user's face. Using two sets of IR-LEDs rigidly attached to the camera and OST-HMD frame, we can calculate the correct projection for different eye positions in real time and changes in HMD position within several frames. To verify the accuracy of our method, we conducted two experiments with a commercial HMD by calibrating a number of different eye and camera positions. Ground truth was measured through markers on both the camera and HMD screens, and we achieve a viewing accuracy of 1.66 degrees for the eyes of 5 different experiment participants.},

abstract={We present TactileVR, a proof-of-concept virtual reality system in which a user is free to move around and interact with physical objects and toys, which are represented in the virtual world. By integrating tracking information from the head, hands and feet of the user, as well as the objects, we infer complex gestures and interactions such as shaking a toy, rotating a steering wheel, or clapping your hands. We create educational and recreational experiences for kids, which promote exploration and discovery, while feeling intuitive and safe. In each experience objects have a unique appearance and behavior e.g. in an electric circuits lab toy blocks serve as switches, batteries and light bulbs.We conducted a user study with children ages 5-11, who experienced TactileVR and interacted with virtual proxies of physical objects. Children took instantly to the TactileVR environment, intuitively discovered a variety of interactions, and completed tasks faster than with non-tactile virtual objects. Moreover, the presence of physical toys created the opportunity for collaborative play, even when only some of the kids were using a VR headset.},

abstract={It has been shown in numerous studies that the application of Augmented Reality (AR) to teaching and learning is beneficial, but determining the reasons behind its effectiveness, and in particular the characteristics of students for whom an AR is best suited, can bring forth new opportunities to integrate adaptive instruction and AR in the future. Through a quasi-experimental research design, our study recruited 66 participants in an 8-week long AR-assisted learning activity, and lag sequential analysis was used to analyze participants' behavior in an AR learning environment. We found that AR was more effective in enhancing the learning gains in elementary school science of learners who prefer a Kinesthetic approach to learning. We hypothesize that these effects are due to the increase in opportunity for hands-on activities, effectively increasing learners' concentration and passion for learning.},

abstract={Reality Skins enables mobile and large-scale virtual reality experiences, dynamically generated based on the user's environment. A head-mounted display (HMD) coupled with a depth camera is used to scan the user's surroundings: reconstruct geometry, infer floor plans, and detect objects and obstacles. From these elements we generate a Reality Skin, a 3D environment which replaces office or apartment walls with the corridors of a spaceship or underground tunnels, replacing chairs and desks, sofas and beds with crates and computer consoles, fungi and crumbling ancient statues. The placement of walls, furniture and objects in the Reality Skin attempts to approximate reality, such that the user can move around, and touch virtual objects with tactile feedback from real objects. Each possible reality skins world consists of objects, materials and custom scripts. Taking cues from the user's surroundings, we create a unique environment combining these building blocks, attempting to preserve the geometry and semantics of the real world.We tackle 3D environment generation as a constraint satisfaction problem, and break it into two parts: First, we use a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo optimization, over a simple 2D polygonal model, to infer the layout of the environment (the structure of the virtual world). Then, we populate the world with various objects and characters, attempting to satisfy geometric (virtual objects should align with objects in the environment), semantic (a virtual chair aligns with a real one), physical (avoid collisions, maintain stability) and other constraints. We find a discrete set of transformations for each object satisfying unary constraints, incorporate pairwise and higher-order constraints, and optimize globally using a very recent technique based on semidefinite relaxation.},

abstract={Discrepancy check is a well-known task in industrial Augmented Reality (AR). In this paper we present a new approach consisting of three main contributions: First, we propose a new two-step depth mapping algorithm for RGB-D cameras, which fuses depth images with given camera pose in real-time into a consistent 3D model. In a rigorous evaluation with two public benchmarks we show that our mapping outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy. Second, we propose a semi-automatic alignment algorithm, which rapidly aligns a reference model to the reconstruction. Third, we propose an algorithm for 3D discrepancy check based on pre-computed distances. In a systematic evaluation we show the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art 3D discrepancy checks.},
