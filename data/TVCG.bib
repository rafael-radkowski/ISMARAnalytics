Conventional head-worn displays (HWDs) are not able to display the same high dynamic range of brightness and color as the human eye can perceive in the real world. To mimic the perception of real-world scenes in virtual scenes, it is crucial to reproduce the effects of incident light on the human visual system. In order to advance virtual simulations towards perceptual realism, we present an eye-tracked VR/AR simulation comprising effects for gaze-dependent temporal eye adaption, perceptual glare, visual acuity reduction, and scotopic color vision. Our simulation is based on medical expert knowledge and medical studies of the healthy human eye. We conducted the first user study comparing the perception of light in a real-world low-light scene to a VR simulation. Our results show that the proposed combination of simulated visual effects is well received by users and also indicate that an individual adaptation is necessary, because perception of light is highly subjective.},  keywords={augmented reality;colour vision;eye;helmet mounted displays;human factors;vision defects;visual perception;light perception;virtual reality;conventional head-worn displays;high dynamic range;brightness;virtual scenes;human visual system;virtual simulations;perceptual realism;gaze-dependent temporal eye adaption;visual acuity reduction;scotopic color vision;real-world low-light scene;VR simulation;simulated visual effects;gaze-dependent simulation;Adaptation models;Solid modeling;Lighting;Virtual reality;Retina;Augmented reality;Computational modeling;Head-mounted displays;Perception;virtual reality;user studies},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023604},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Dec},}

The main challenge is that the decomposition is ill-posed, especially in indoor scenes where lighting conditions are complicated, while real training data is inadequate. To solve this challenge, we propose NIID-Net, a novel learning-based framework that adapts surface normal knowledge for improving the decomposition. The knowledge learned from relatively more abundant data for surface normal estimation is integrated into intrinsic image decomposition in two novel ways. First, normal feature adapters are proposed to incorporate scene geometry features when decomposing the image. Secondly, a map of integrated lighting is proposed for propagating object contour and planarity information during shading rendering. Furthermore, this map is capable of representing spatially-varying lighting conditions indoors. Experiments show that NIID-Net achieves competitive performance in reflectance estimation and outperforms all previous methods in shading estimation quantitatively and qualitatively.

Unlike most existing state-of-the-art systems which produce only point cloud based 3D models online or surface mesh offline, we propose a novel online incremental mesh generation approach to achieve fast online dense surface mesh reconstruction to satisfy the demand of real-time AR applications. For each keyframe of 6DoF tracking, we perform a robust monocular depth estimation, with a multi-view semi-global matching method followed by a depth refinement post-processing. The proposed mesh generation module incrementally fuses each estimated keyframe depth map to an online dense surface mesh, which is useful for achieving realistic AR effects such as occlusions and collisions. We verify our real-time reconstruction results on two mid-range mobile platforms.

We present a novel method to synthesize photorealistic video portraits for an input portrait video, automatically driven by a person's voice. The main challenge in this task is the hallucination of plausible, photorealistic facial expressions from input speech audio. To address this challenge, we employ a parametric 3D face model represented by geometry, facial expression, illumination, etc., and learn a mapping from audio features to model parameters. The input source audio is first represented as a high-dimensional feature, which is used to predict facial expression parameters of the 3D face model. We then replace the expression parameters computed from the original target video with the predicted one, and rerender the reenacted face. Finally, we generate a photorealistic video portrait from the reenacted synthetic face sequence via a neural face renderer. One appealing feature of our approach is the generalization capability for various input speech audio, including synthetic speech audio from text-to-speech software. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous general-purpose audio-driven video portrait methods. This includes a user study demonstrating that our results are rated as more realistic than previous methods.},  keywords={image representation;image sequences;text-to-speech software;input speech audio synthesis;synthetic face sequence;general-purpose audio-driven video portrait methods;neural face renderer;facial expression parameters;parametric 3D face model;photorealistic facial expressions;virtual education;photorealistic audio-driven video portraits;Face recognition;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Streaming media;Rendering (computer graphics);Image reconstruction;Training data;Audio-driven animation;facial reenactment;generative models;talking-head video generation},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023573},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Dec},}

Compared to the holographic displays based on Liquid Crystal on Silicon Spatial Light Modulators (LCoS SLMs), NPAs have the advantage of integrated light source and high refresh rate. However, the formation of the desired wavefront requires accurate modulation of the phase which is distorted by the thermal proximity effect. This problem has been largely overlooked and existing approaches to similar problems are either slow or do not provide a good result in the setting of NPAs. We propose two new algorithms based on the iterative phase retrieval algorithm and the proximal algorithm to address this challenge.

Firstly, the currently available training data is insufficient for the training of 360° SOD deep model. Secondly, the visual distortions in 360° omnidirectional images usually result in large feature gap between 360° images and 2D images; consequently, the widely used stage-wise training-a widely-used solution to alleviate the training data shortage problem, becomes infeasible when conducing SOD in 360° omnidirectional images. Thirdly, the existing 360° SOD approach has followed a multi-task methodology that performs salient object localization and segmentation-like saliency refinement at the same time, being faced with extremely large problem domain, making the training data shortage dilemma even worse. To tackle all these issues, this paper divides the 360° SOD into a multi-staqe task, the key rationale of which is to decompose the original complex problem domain into sequential easy sub problems that only demand for small-scale training data. Meanwhile, we learn how to rank the “object-level semantical saliency”, aiming to locate salient viewpoints and objects accurately. Specifically, to alleviate the training data shortage problem, we have released a novel dataset named 360-SSOD, containing 1,105 360° omnidirectional images with manually annotated object-level saliency ground truth, whose semantical distribution is more balanced than that of the existing dataset. Also, we have compared the proposed method with 13 SOTA methods, and all quantitative results have demonstrated the performance superiority.},  keywords={feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;360° omnidirectional image;training data shortage problem;salient object localization;segmentation-like saliency refinement;omnidirectional images;object-level saliency ground truth;stage-wise salient object detection;object-level semantical saliency ranking;SOD deep model;SOD approach;Two dimensional displays;Visualization;Distortion;Training data;Object detection;Task analysis;Virtual Reality;360° Omnidirectional Image;Multi-stage Salient Object Detection;Semantical Saliency},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023636},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Dec},}

We present the results of a lab study (N=33) where the auditory and haptic sense of participants was trained to be an indicator for real world boundaries, while their visual sense was bound to a VR experience with an HMD. Our results suggests that allocating senses increases workload. However, while performance is comparable to purely visual indications of boundaries, sense allocation seems to improve presence.

Existing light-attenuation displays have limited color fidelity and contrast, resulting in a degraded appearance of virtual images. To use these displays to present virtual images that are more consistent with the real world, we require three things: intensity modulation of incoming light, spatial color filtering with narrower bandwidth, and appropriate light modulation for incoming light with an arbitrary spectral distribution. In StainedView, we address the three requirements by cascading two phase-only spatial light modulators (PSLMs), a digital micromirror device, and polarization optics to control both light intensity and spectrum distribution. We show that our design has a 1.8 times wider color gamut fidelity (75.8% fulfillment of sRGB color space) compared to the existing single-PSLM approach (41.4%) under a reference white light.

While particular attention was given to assess spatial presence in real and virtual environments, few have been interested in measuring it in telepresence situations. To bridge this gap, the present work introduces a study that compares the execution of a task in three conditions: a real physical environment, a remote environment via a telepresence system, and a virtual simulation of the real environment. Following a within-subject design, 27 participants performed a navigation task consisting in following a route while avoiding obstacles. Spatial presence and five related factors (affordance, enjoyment, attention allocation, reality, and cybersickness) were evaluated using a presence questionnaire. In addition, performance measures were gathered regarding environment recollection and task execution. The evaluation also included a behavioral metric measured by obstacle avoidance distance extracted from participants' trajectories. Results indicated a higher presence in the real environment, along with the best performance measures. No difference was found in spatial presence between the remote and the virtual conditions, although a higher degree of affordance and enjoyment was attributed to the virtual environment, and a higher degree of reality was attributed to the remote environment. The number of collisions was found to be lower in the remote condition compared to the virtual condition. Similarly, the avoidance distance was also bigger (and almost similar) in the real and the remote environments compared to the virtual environment indicating a greater caution of participants. These cues highlight that the behavior of participants in the remote condition was closer to their behavior in the real situation than it was in the virtual condition. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between the reality factor and two of the three performance measures, as well as with the behavioral metric. This suggests that the degree of physical existence of the space in which participants operate can influence their performance and behavior.},  keywords={user experience;virtual reality;virtual condition;virtual environment;remote environment;remote condition;spatial presence;virtual immersive environments;physical environment;presence questionnaire;environment recollection;Virtual environments;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Behavioral sciences;Spatial augmented reality;Spatial presence;remote and virtual environments;user evaluation;performance and behavioral mesures},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023574},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Dec},}

We found that walking and increased path curvature negatively affected the overall spatial accuracy of the performance, and that the performance benefited more from using the torso as the reference frame than the head.

Previous research primarily focused on the development of AR navigation systems designed for specific displaying devices, but differences between employed methods have not been investigated before. To this end, a user study involving a needle insertion task was conducted comparing different AR display techniques with a monitor-based approach as baseline condition for the visualization of navigation information. A video see-through stationary display, an optical see-through head-mounted display and a spatial AR projector-camera-system were investigated in this comparison. Results suggest advantages of using projected navigation information in terms of lower task completion time, lower angular deviation and affirmative subjective participant feedback. Techniques requiring the intermediate view on screens, i.e. the stationary display and the baseline condition, showed less favorable results. Thus, benefits of providing AR navigation information compared to a conventionally used method could be identified. Significant objective measures results, as well as an identification of advantages and disadvantages of individual display techniques contribute to the development and design of improved needle navigation systems.},  keywords={augmented reality;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;human factors;medical computing;needles;specific displaying devices;needle insertion task;stationary display;head-mounted display;projector-camera-system;navigation information;task completion time;angular deviation;AR navigation information;conventionally used method;needle navigation systems;AR display techniques;AR navigation systems;hand-eye coordination;mental workload;medical needle insertion;augmented reality display techniques;Navigation;Augmented reality;Biomedical monitoring;Navigation;Data visualization;Phantoms;Optical imaging;Medical augmented reality;display techniques;surgical navigation systems;needle guidance;visuospatial task},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023637},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Dec},}

One advantage of VR knowledge work is that it allows extending 2D displays into the third dimension, enabling new operations, such as selecting overlapping objects or displaying additional layers of information. On the other hand, mobile knowledge workers often work on established mobile devices, such as tablets, limiting interaction with those devices to a small input space. This challenge of a constrained input space is intensified in situations when VR knowledge work is situated in cramped environments, such as airplanes and touchdown spaces. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of interacting jointly between an immersive VR head-mounted display and a tablet within the context of knowledge work.

Correct object association is the key factor to achieve a successful object SLAM system because object association and SLAM are inherently coupled and have not been well tackled yet. A novel formulation of the object association problem based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is proposed. Through the HDP, we can hierarchically associate the grouped object measurements. This can improve the object association accuracy and computation efficiency. Thanks to the novel formulation, the proposed method is also able to correct failure object associations according to its sampling inference algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce object poses to the processing of pose optimization. The object association and pose optimization are then solved in a tightly coupled way, by which both aspects can promote each other. The proposed method is evaluated on indoor and outdoor datasets and the experimental results show a very impressive improvement with respect to the traditional SLAM.},  keywords={inference mechanisms;SLAM (robots);semantic SLAM;semantic objects association;grouped object measurements;computation efficiency;failure object associations;hierarchical topic model based object association;object-based simultaneous localization and mapping;object SLAM system;sampling inference algorithm;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Semantics;Optimization;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Atmospheric modeling;Computer science;Visual Semantic SLAM;Object Association;Hierarchical Dirichlet Process},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932216},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

This problem has important applications in mixed reality, such as telepresence, interior design or as-built documentation. Unlike conventional texture optimization in structure from motion, our method must choose views from the input stream in a strictly incremental manner, since only a small number of views can be stored or transmitted. This requires formulating an online variant of the well-known view-planning problem, which must take into account what parts of the scene have already been seen and how the lumigraph sample distribution could improve in the future. We address this highly unconstrained problem by regularizing the scene structure using a regular grid structure. Upon the grid structure, we define a coverage metric describing how well the lumigraph samples cover the grid in terms of spatial and angular resolution, and we greedily keep incoming views if they improve the coverage. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively on a variety of synthetic and real scenes, and demonstrate visually appealing results obtained at real-time frame rates (in the range of 3Hz-100Hz per incoming image, depending on configuration).},  keywords={graph theory;image resolution;image texture;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality;time view planning;unstructured lumigraph modeling;image stream;mixed reality;telepresence;interior design;conventional texture optimization;strictly incremental manner;online variant;well-known view-planning problem;lumigraph sample distribution;highly unconstrained problem;scene structure;regular grid structure;lumigraph samples;spatial resolution;angular resolution;incoming views;synthetic scenes;real scenes;real-time frame rates;Planning;Image reconstruction;Real-time systems;Geometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Computational modeling;Image color analysis;Lumigraph;virtual reality;rendering;real-time;view planning;keyframe selection;multi-view},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932237},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

This method can achieve high quality reconstructions so long as the scene is densely acquired from multiple views with sufficient overlap between nearby images. However, it is challenging for a human operator to know during acquisition if sufficient coverage has been achieved. Insufficient coverage of the scene can result in holes, missing regions, or even a complete failure of reconstruction. These errors require manually repairing the model or returning to the scene to acquire additional views, which is time-consuming and often infeasible. We present a novel approach to photogrammetric acquisition that uses an AR HMD to predict a set of covering views and to interactively guide an operator to capture imagery from each view. The operator wears an AR HMD and uses a handheld camera rig that is tracked relative to the AR HMD with a fiducial marker. The AR HMD tracks its pose relative to the environment and automatically generates a coarse geometric model of the scene, which our approach analyzes at runtime to generate a set of human-reachable acquisition views covering the scene with consistent camera-to-scene distance and image overlap. The generated view locations are rendered to the operator on the AR HMD. Interactive visual feedback informs the operator how to align the camera to assume each suggested pose. When the camera is in range, an image is automatically captured. In this way, a set of images suitable for 3D reconstruction can be captured in a matter of minutes. In a user study, participants who were novices at photogrammetry were tasked with acquiring a challenging and complex scene either without guidance or with our AR HMD based guidance. Participants using our guidance achieved improved reconstructions without cases of reconstruction failure as in the control condition. Our AR HMD based approach is self-contained, portable, and provides specific acquisition guidance tailored to the geometry of the scene being captured.},  keywords={cameras;computer vision;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;image capture;image reconstruction;image sensors;photogrammetry;rendering (computer graphics);stereo image processing;high quality reconstructions;nearby images;human operator;photogrammetric acquisition;handheld camera rig;human-reachable acquisition views;consistent camera-to-scene distance;AR HMD based guidance;hand-held 3D acquisition control;3D reconstruction;coarse geometric model;image overlap;interactive visual feedback;Image reconstruction;Cameras;Resists;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Smart phones;Geometry;Augmented reality;head-mounted display;photogrammetry;3D reconstruction},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932172},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

However, existing prototyping tools can only present a product imperfectly, due to limitations at different levels. Specifically, the physical product model, which may be the product of 3D printing, could lack a visual interface; the presentation of the product through modeling software such as Rhinoceros 3D does not provide good realistic tactile perception; or the interface platforms, such as Axure RP, used to display the interactive effects differ from those to be used in the actual operation. Thus, we present the VPModel, a high-fidelity prototyping tool, able to integrate multiple prototyping methods simultaneously. It combines a touchable 3D-printed product model (3DPM) and a corresponding visualized virtual model, and the interactive interfaces are rendered synchronously in a mixed-reality device. Through the tangible, visual, and interactive demonstration, designers and normal users can each obtain a similar experience to the experience of the finished product. Furthermore, the VPModel also enhances design practices by enabling comparisons between modular models. However, the implementation of this system is a challenging task, which subsumes several fundamental problems as sub-tasks: object detection, real-time matching, hand-gesture detection and action recognition. To achieve the expected goals of the VPModel, this system uses physical hardware (a Microsoft MR HoloLens headset, a Leap Motion Controller, and a 3D printer) and existing machine learning algorithms. To evaluate our VPModel, we report the user experience of 16 participants, evaluated using a closed-ended questionnaire survey, a quantitative analysis of task performance, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended interviews. The results show a significant improvement in realism and enjoyment using the VPModel over the two traditional camera prototype approaches. In summary, the VPModel can be used to support design strategy and to convey design concepts fully and efficiently, which indicates a potential use for the VPModel in shortening product development cycles and reducing communication costs.},  keywords={data visualisation;gesture recognition;haptic interfaces;image matching;object detection;product development;production engineering computing;stereo image processing;three-dimensional printing;user experience;virtual reality;VPModel;high-fidelity product simulation;virtual-physical environment;physical product model;visual interface;Rhinoceros 3D;high-fidelity prototyping tool;3DPM;modular models;physical hardware;user experience;product development cycles;tactile perception;communication costs;3D-printed product model;object detection;real-time matching;hand-gesture detection;action recognition;machine learning algorithms;visualized virtual model;camera prototype approaches;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Tools;Prototypes;Visualization;Real-time systems;Software;Designers;high-fidelity prototyping tool;3D printed model;mixed reality;Adult;Augmented Reality;Computer Graphics;Consumer Behavior;Female;Humans;Male;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Surveys and Questionnaires;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932276},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

In dynamic scenes, object tracking maintains the illusion if the physical and virtual objects are well aligned. However, traditional trackers based on texture or contour information are often distracted by the projected content and tend to fail. In this paper, we present a model-based tracking strategy, which directly takes advantage from the projected content for pose estimation in a projector-camera system. An iterative pose estimation algorithm captures and exploits visible distortions caused by object movements. In a closed-loop, the corrected pose allows the update of the projection for the subsequent frame. Synthetic frames simulating the projection on the model are rendered and an optical flow-based method minimizes the difference between edges of the rendered and the camera image. Since the thresholds automatically adapt to the synthetic image, a complicated radiometric calibration can be avoided. The pixel-wise linear optimization is designed to be easily implemented on the GPU. Our approach can be combined with a regular contour-based tracker and is transferable to other problems, like the estimation of the extrinsic pose between projector and camera. We evaluate our procedure with real and synthetic images and obtain very precise registration results.},  keywords={calibration;cameras;image registration;image segmentation;image sequences;image texture;iterative methods;linear programming;object tracking;pose estimation;rendering (computer graphics);object movements;synthetic frames;optical flow-based method;camera image;synthetic image;regular contour-based tracker;projection distortion-based object tracking;shader lamp scenarios;shader lamp systems;dynamic scenes;physical objects;virtual objects;texture;model-based tracking strategy;projected content;projector-camera system;iterative pose estimation;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Pose estimation;Mathematical model;Calibration;Object tracking;Projector-camera systems;projector-camera calibration;shader lamp systems;object tracking;object registration;spatial augmented reality;projection mapping},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932223},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

Mutually consistent occlusions between physical and digital objects are typically not supported. When mutual occlusion is supported, it is only supported for a fixed depth. We propose a new optical see-through AR display system that renders mutual occlusion in a depth-dependent, perceptually realistic manner.

We discuss the potential relationships between simulator sickness, immersion, and presence. We used two different camera pose (position and orientation) estimation methods for the evaluation of motion tasks in a large-scale VR environment: a simple model and an optimized model that allows for a more accurate and natural mapping of human senses. Participants performed multiple motion tasks (walking, balancing, running) in three conditions: a physical reality baseline condition, a VR condition with the simple model, and a VR condition with the optimized model. We compared these conditions with regard to the resulting sickness and gait, as well as the perceived presence in the VR conditions. The subjective measures confirmed that the optimized pose estimation model reduces simulator sickness and increases the perceived presence. The results further show that both models affect the gait parameters and simulator sickness, which is why we further investigated a classification approach that deals with non-linear correlation dependencies between gait parameters and simulator sickness. We argue that our approach could be used to assess and predict simulator sickness based on human gait parameters and we provide implications for future research.},  keywords={gait analysis;pose estimation;virtual reality;sick moves;motion parameters;simulator sickness;large-scale VR environment;optimized model;multiple motion tasks;physical reality baseline condition;VR condition;perceived presence;optimized pose estimation model;human gait parameters;Legged locomotion;Solid modeling;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Computational modeling;Reliability;Pose estimation;Human-centered computing;virtual reality;user studies;computing methodologies;perception;machine learning;Adult;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Female;Gait;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Male;Models, Statistical;Motion Sickness;Movement;Psychomotor Performance;Virtual Reality;Young Adult},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932224},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

We developed four egocentric cues which characterize the four independent dimensions of the matrix: arrow, path, glow, and radial, and a single exocentric world in miniature visualization. Our study shows that virtual attachment cues are preferred, providing the highest accuracy, highest performance when collaborators are occluded, and produce the least mental effort when used with a single virtual collaborator. For multiple collaborators however, the virtual attached, world animated radial cue produces significant increases in mental load and reductions in preference, demonstrating the impact of visual augmentation clutter. The single exocentric visualization produced higher levels of head movement, and poorer accuracy, however the novelty of the visualization produced positive qualitative results.},  keywords={augmented reality;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;spatial augmented reality systems;extended reality technologies;single exocentric visualization;visual augmentation clutter;world animated radial cue;multiple collaborators;single virtual collaborator;virtual attachment cues;single exocentric world;independent dimensions;egocentric cues;determining dimensions;spatial-communication taxonomy;SAR environments;spatial cues;virtual environment;augmented physical environment;first-person camera view;head-mounted display;tablet interface;viewing technology;xR collaborations;spatial awareness cues;Collaboration;Visualization;Taxonomy;Stakeholders;Spatial augmented reality;Virtual environments;Animation;Extended reality;spatial augmented reality;awareness;augmented reality;collaboration;virtual reality;Adult;Computer Graphics;Cues;Female;Head Movements;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Video Games;Virtual Reality;Young Adult},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932173},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

Recent research has investigated how physical keyboards can be used in immersive head-mounted display-based Virtual Reality (VR). So far, the physical layout of keyboards has typically been transplanted into VR for replicating typing experiences in a standard desktop environment. In this paper, we explore how to fully leverage the immersiveness of VR to change the input and output characteristics of physical keyboard interaction within a VR environment. This allows individual physical keys to be reconfigured to the same or different actions and visual output to be distributed in various ways across the VR representation of the keyboard. We explore a set of input and output mappings for reconfiguring the virtual presentation of physical keyboards and probe the resulting design space by specifically designing, implementing and evaluating nine VR-relevant applications: emojis, languages and special characters, application shortcuts, virtual text processing macros, a window manager, a photo browser, a whack-a-mole game, secure password entry and a virtual touch bar. We investigate the feasibility of the applications in a user study with 20 participants and find that, among other things, they are usable in VR. We discuss the limitations and possibilities of remapping the input and output characteristics of physical keyboards in VR based on empirical findings and analysis and suggest future research directions in this area.},  keywords={helmet mounted displays;keyboards;virtual reality;efficient standard text entry devices;physical keyboard interaction;VR environment;standard text entry devices;immersive head-mounted display-based virtual reality;standard desktop environment;VR representation;virtual text processing macros;window manager;photo browser;whack-a-mole game;secure password entry;virtual touch bar;emojis;languages;ReconViguRation;input-output mappings;Keyboards;Visualization;Virtual reality;Sensors;Tracking;Password;Task analysis;Virtual Reality;Text Entry;Physical Keyboards},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932239},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

Although it sounds as a classical technical issue, to the best of our knowledge there is no existing solution to alleviate the spatial non-uniformity among strongly heterogeneous projectors at perceptually acceptable quality. Primary goal of our method is increasing the perceived seamlessness of the projection system by automatically generating an improved and consistent visual quality. It builds upon the existing research of multi-projection systems, but instead of working with perceptually non-uniform color spaces such as CIEXYZ, the overall computation is carried out using the RLab [10, pp. 243-254] color appearance model which models the color processing in an adaptive, perceptual manner. Besides, we propose an adaptive color gamut acquisition, spatially varying gamut mapping, and optimization framework for edge blending.

Comporting with existing cognitive neuroscience literature on prediction, attentional orienting, and interference, we hypothesized that for both simple procedural tasks and complex search-based tasks, having a visual cue guiding to the next task's location would positively impact performance relative to a baseline, no-cue condition.

This approach allows 3D reconstruction of experiences at any location and virtual tours from anywhere. The key innovation of the proposed ego-centric reconstruction system is to capture the wearer's body pose and facial expression from near-body views, e.g. cameras on the user's glasses, and to capture the surrounding environment using outward-facing views. The main challenge of the ego-centric reconstruction, however, is the poor coverage of the near-body views - that is, the user's body and face are observed from vantage points that are convenient for wear but inconvenient for capture. To overcome these challenges, we propose a parametric-model-based approach to user motion estimation. This approach utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for near-view body pose estimation, and we introduce a CNN-based approach for facial expression estimation that combines audio and video. For each time-point during capture, the intermediate model-based reconstructions from these systems are used to re-target a high-fidelity pre-scanned model of the user. We demonstrate that the proposed self-sufficient, head-worn capture system is capable of reconstructing the wearer's movements and their surrounding environment in both indoor and outdoor situations without any additional views. As a proof of concept, we show how the resulting 3D-plus-time reconstruction can be immersively experienced within a virtual reality system (e.g., the HTC Vive). We expect that the size of the proposed egocentric capture-and-reconstruction system will eventually be reduced to fit within future AR glasses, and will be widely useful for immersive 3D telepresence, virtual tours, and general use-anywhere 3D content creation.},  keywords={cameras;computer vision;convolution;face recognition;feedforward neural nets;image reconstruction;mobile computing;motion estimation;pose estimation;solid modelling;virtual reality;environment capture;head-worn cameras;dynamic indoor scenes;virtual tours;ego-centric reconstruction system;near-body views;parametric-model-based approach;user motion estimation;convolutional neural networks;CNN-based approach;facial expression estimation;intermediate model-based reconstructions;high-fidelity pre-scanned model;head-worn capture system;3D-plus-time reconstruction;virtual reality system;immersive 3D telepresence;use-anywhere 3D content creation;capture-and-reconstruction system;fully mobile 3D face capture;AR glasses;HTC Vive;near-view body pose estimation;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Face;Solid modeling;Pose estimation;Deformable models;Telepresence;Ego-centric Vision;Motion Capture;Convolutional Neural Networks;Facial Expression;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Internet;Neural Networks, Computer;Posture;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2868527},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

These are good reasons to want instead to capture several smaller sub-scenes that can be joined to make the whole scene. Achieving this has traditionally been difficult: joining sub-scenes that may never have been viewed from the same angle requires a high-quality camera relocaliser that can cope with novel poses, and tracking drift in each sub-scene can prevent them from being joined to make a consistent overall scene. Recent advances, however, have significantly improved our ability to capture medium-sized sub-scenes with little to no tracking drift: real-time globally consistent reconstruction systems can close loops and re-integrate the scene surface on the fly, whilst new visual-inertial odometry approaches can significantly reduce tracking drift during live reconstruction. Moreover, high-quality regression forest-based relocalisers have recently been made more practical by the introduction of a method to allow them to be trained and used online. In this paper, we leverage these advances to present what to our knowledge is the first system to allow multiple users to collaborate interactively to reconstruct dense, voxel-based models of whole buildings using only consumer-grade hardware, a task that has traditionally been both time-consuming and dependent on the availability of specialised hardware. Using our system, an entire house or lab can be reconstructed in under half an hour and at a far lower cost than was previously possible.},  keywords={cameras;distance measurement;image reconstruction;optimisation;pose estimation;regression analysis;large-scale dense 3D reconstruction;online inter-agent pose optimisation;volumetric models;high-quality camera relocaliser;tracking drift;medium-sized sub-scenes;high-quality regression forest-based relocalisers;visual-inertial odometry approach;voxel-based model;consumer-grade hardware;Robots;Collaboration;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Buildings;Visualization;Hardware;Collaborative;large-scale;dense 3D reconstruction;inter-agent relocalisation;pose graph optimisation},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2868533},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

Furthermore, complex MR environments may be comprised of a large number of objects which can be distributed in the extended surrounding space of the user.

However, while the form-factor of an OST-HMD occupies less of the user's visual field than in the past, it can still result in critical oversights, e.g., missing a pedestrian while driving a car. In this paper, we design and compare two methods to compensate for the loss of awareness due to the occlusion caused by OST-HMDs. Instead of presenting the occluded content to the user, we detect motion that is not visible to the user and highlight its direction either on the edge of the HMD screen, or by activating LEDs placed in the user's peripheral vision. The methods involve an offline stage, where the occluded visual field and location of each indicator and its associated occluded region of interest (OROI) are determined, and an online stage, where an enhanced optical flow algorithm tracks the motion in the occluded visual field. We have implemented both methods on a Microsoft HoloLens and an ODG R-9. Our prototype systems achieved success rates of 100% in an objective evaluation, and 98.90% in a pilot user study.

Particularly, vehicles with augmented reality (AR) graphics delivered via head-up displays (HUDs) are nearing mainstream commercial feasibility and will be widely implemented over the next decade. Though AR graphics have been shown to provide tangible benefits to drivers in scenarios like forward collision warnings and navigation, they also create many new perceptual and sensory issues for drivers. For some time now, designers have focused on increasing the realism and quality of virtual graphics delivered via HUDs, and recently have begun testing more advanced 3D HUD systems that deliver volumetric spatial information to drivers. However, the realization of volumetric graphics adds further complexity to the design and delivery of AR cues, and moreover, parameters in this new design space must be clearly and operationally defined and explored. In this work, we present two user studies that examine how driver performance and visual attention are affected when using fixed and animated AR HUD interface design approaches in driving scenarios that require top-down and bottom-up cognitive processing. Results demonstrate that animated design approaches can produce some driving gains (e.g., in goal-directed navigation tasks) but often come at the cost of response time and distance. Our discussion yields AR HUD design recommendations and challenges some of the existing assumptions of world-fixed conformal graphic approaches to design.},  keywords={augmented reality;cognition;computer animation;driver information systems;head-up displays;user interfaces;augmented reality interface design approaches;driving tasks;automotive industry;head-up displays;HUDs;AR graphics;sensory issues;virtual graphics;volumetric spatial information;volumetric graphics;driver performance;AR HUD interface design approaches;animated design approaches;vehicle technologies;graphic approaches;3D HUD systems;bottom-up cognitive processing;top-down cognitive processing;Vehicles;Task analysis;Visualization;Navigation;Roads;Augmented reality;Mixed-reality;augmented reality;driving;head-up displays},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2868531},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

The results of a pilot study on narrative and spatial memory are presented in the context of viewing real and virtual copies of a simulated crime scene. Based on current court procedures, three different viewing options were compared: photographs, a real life visit, and a 3D virtual reconstruction of the scene viewed in a Virtual Reality headset. Participants were also given a written narrative that included the spatial locations of stolen goods and were measured on their ability to recall and understand these spatial relationships of those stolen items. The results suggest that Virtual Reality is more reliable for spatial memory compared to photographs and that Virtual Reality provides a compromise for when physical viewing of crime scenes are not possible. We conclude that Virtual Reality is a promising medium for the court.},  keywords={criminal law;forensic science;virtual reality;virtual reconstruction;written narrative;spatial locations;spatial relationships;spatial memory;photographs;physical viewing;jury viewings;virtual copies;current court procedures;virtual reality headset;crime scene simulation;narrative memory;virtual environment reconstruction;viewing options;courtroom;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Law enforcement;Virtual environments;Image reconstruction;Videos;Virtual Reality;virtual environments;narrative memory;spatial memory;crime scene viewing;Adult;Crime;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Jurisprudence;Male;Mental Recall;Middle Aged;Narration;Spatial Memory;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2868569},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}

With the idea that AR systems will soon be able to label real-world objects in any language in real time, our within-subjects (N=52) lab-based study explores the effect of such an AR vocabulary prompter on participants learning nouns in an unfamiliar foreign language, compared to a traditional flashcard-based learning approach. Our results show that the immersive AR experience of learning with virtual labels on real-world objects is both more effective and more enjoyable for the majority of participants, compared to flashcards. Specifically, when participants learned through augmented reality, they scored significantly better on both same-day and 4-day delayed productive recall tests than when they learned using the flashcard method. We believe this result is an indication of the strong potential for language learning in augmented reality, particularly because of the improvement shown in sustained recall compared to the traditional approach.},  keywords={augmented reality;computer aided instruction;natural language processing;vocabulary;augmented reality;flashcard method;language learning;ARbis pictus;AR technology;immersive vocabulary learning;AR vocabulary prompter;virtual labels;foreign language;flashcard-based learning;Augmented reality;Vocabulary;Education;Task analysis;Games;Labeling;Language learning;education;augmented reality;HCl;experimentation},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2868568},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={Nov},}
