	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a system that can reproduce the material appearance of real objects using mobile augmented reality (AR). Our proposed system allows a user to manipulate a virtual object, whose model is generated from the shape and reflectance of a real object, using the user's own hand. The shape of the real object is reconstructed by integrating depth images of the object, which are captured using an RGB-D camera from different directions. The reflectance of the object is obtained by estimating the parameters of a reflectance model from the reconstructed shape and color images, assuming that a single light source is attached to the camera. We measured the shape and reflectance of some real objects and presented the material appearance of the objects using mobile AR. It was confirmed that users were able to obtain the perception of materials from changes in gloss and burnish of the objects by rotating the objects using their own hand.},

	Abstract = {Unrealistic Mixed Reality (MR) experiences can be caused by unprocessed occlusions between real and augmented objects during interactions. Depth knowledge is indeed key to achieve a seamless visualisation when a bare hand interacts with an augmented object. This can be addressed by blending real-time 3D finger tracking information with the visualisation of the hand in MR. We propose an approach that automatically localises the hand in RGB images and associates the respective depth, estimated with an auxiliary infrared stereo camera used for hand tracking, to each RGB hand pixel. Because misalignments between the outline of the hand and its depth may occur due to tracking errors, we use the distance transform algorithm to densely associate depth values to hand pixels. In this way hand and augmented object depths can be compared, and the object can be rendered accordingly. We evaluate our approach by using an MR setup composed of a smartphone and a Leap Motion mounted on it. We analyse several hand configurations and measure the erroneously classified pixels when occlusions occur.},

The user experience with such technologies depends to a large degree on the perceived trust in and reliability of the IVA. In this poster, we explore the effects of a three-dimensional embodied representation of Amazon Alexa in Augmented Reality (AR) on the user's perceived trust in her being able to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a smart home environment. We present a preliminary study and discuss the potential of positive effects in perceived trust due to the embodied representation compared to a voice-only condition.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to semantic segmentation and structural modeling from dense 3D point clouds. The core contribution is an efficient method for fitting of geometric primitives based on machine learning. First, the dense 3D point cloud is acquired together with RGB images on a mobile handheld device. Then, RANSAC is used to estimate the presence of geometric primitives, followed by an evaluation of their fit based on classification of the fitting parameters. Finally, the approach iterates over successive frames to optimize the fitting parameters or replace a detected primitive by a better fitting one. As a result, we obtain a semantic model of the scene consisting of a set of geometric primitives. We evaluate the approach on an extensive set of scenarios and show its plausibility in augmented reality applications.},

	Abstract = {Museums and exhibitions often present physical artefacts which may contain rich histories or deep meaning associated with them. These additional contents are often installed physically as informational panels shown on the wall. However, these may sometimes be challenging to deploy due to space constraints. In order to address this challenge, we introduce the use of mixed reality. Mixed reality offers an immersive and interactive experience through the use of head mounted displays and in-air gestures. Visitors can discover additional content virtually, without changing the physical space. For a small-scale exhibition at a cafe, we developed a Microsoft HoloLens application to create an interactive experience on top of a collection of historic physical items. Through public experiences at the caf{\'e}, we received positive feedback of our system. In this paper, we discuss the design and implications of our system, survey results, as well as challenges that were encountered in deploying our mixed reality experience in a public setting.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore how Augmented Reality (AR) and anthropomorphism can be used to assign emotions to common physical objects based on their needs. We developed a novel emotional interaction model among personified physical objects so that they could react to other objects by changing virtual facial expressions. To explore the effect of such an emotional interface, we conducted a user study comparing three types of virtual cues shown on the real objects: (1) information only, (2) emotion only and (3) both information and emotional cues. A significant difference was found in task completion time and the quality of work when adding emotional cues to an informational AR-based guiding system. This implies that adding emotion feedback to informational cues may produce better task results than using informational cues alone.},

	Abstract = {In conventional virtual reality systems, users usually do not perceive and recognize the experience as reality. For example, users of a virtual disaster simulator know, consciously or unconsciously, that the presented disaster is not real, which inherently limits the training effect. To make the virtual experience more believable, we propose a novel real-virtual transiton technique that preserves the sense of ``conviction about reality'' in a virtual environment. This is realized by spatio-temporal smooth transition from the real environment to the virtual environment with omnidirectional video captured in advance at the user's position. Our technique requires less preparation cost and presents a more believable experience compared to existing transition techniques using a handmade 3D replica of the real environment. In this article, reported are the concept of our technique, a prototype system and a preliminary user study that has shown the effectiveness of the technique.},

	Abstract = {We present a diminished reality application running live on consumer mobile devices. In our pre-observation-based approach, the clean 3D scene, free of undesired objects, is scanned beforehand and reconstructed as a high resolution textured 3D model. At runtime, objects added in a region of interest are efficiently removed by projecting the previously captured background. Differences of illumination conditions between scan time and run-time are compensated to obtain seamless results. The proposed approach requires no segmentation or manual input other than the definition of the 3D region of interest to be diminished, and is not based on any particular assumption on the background geometry. We show the potential of our approach by processing a variety of challenging unknown 3D scenes including textured backgrounds, dynamic illumination conditions and foreground objects partially occluding the diminished region. We provide details on our compute shader implementation to make as easy as possible the reimplementation by the community.},

	Abstract = {We propose a method that is effective in tracking 3D hand poses occluded by a real object. Since existing model-based tracking methods rely only on observed images to estimate hand joints, tracking generally fails when the hand joints are largely invisible. This problem becomes more prevalent when the tracked hand is grabbing an object, as occlusion by the object makes it harder to find a proper correspondence between the hand model and observation. The proposed method utilizes the occluded part of the hand as additional information for model-based tracking. The occluded depth information is reconstructed according to the geometric of the object and model-based tracking is employed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). We demonstrate that the reconstructed depth information improves the performance of tracking an object-grabbing hand.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel evaluation of an industry-ready HMD for delivering AR work instructions in a real-life, industrial procedure for novice users. A user study was performed to examine the potential benefits and limitations of a dynamic 3D virtual model and AR text instructions, delivered through an optical see through HMD, for training users in a new industry procedure (i.e., Yaw Motor Servicing of a wind turbine). Measures of task accuracy and completion time were used to evaluate the performance of one group of mechanical engineering students performing this procedure for the first time guided by AR compared to a second group performing it using a tablet-delivered instruction manual. Results showed AR improved accuracy but not speed of task completion. AR significantly increased accuracy on one specific task-step in the procedure, namely measurement of a thin air gap (see figure 1, left panel), but also showed limitations with other task-steps not benefitting or even being slowed down by AR (see figure 1, right panel). Findings speak to the importance of incorporating an analysis at the level of individual task steps in order to fully evaluate AR work instructions.},

One challenge stems from the interactive nature of immersive Virtual Environments (VEs). Placement of contextual information in VEs can be critical to the user experience. This poster describes the use of eye-tracking to alleviate usability issues surrounding information presentation in immersive VEs. Results from our experiments show that integrating eye tracking into a VE to dictate where and when textual information is presented can improve performance when searching for contextual information. In summary, the results show improvement in task performance when the new direct method is employed to reveal information in target regions based on gaze. This seems to hold true independent of the VE or the type of information questioned.},

	Abstract = {As head mounted displays (HMDs) become everyday consumer items, the potential of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as a design space becomes ever more promising. However, their usage is impeded by human factors inherent to the technology itself, such as visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), caused by the disconnect between what is visually and physically perceived. Previous work on VIMS reduction has explored techniques targeting HMDs, while others explored techniques that target the multimedia content itself through visual optimization. The latter are often studied individually and cannot be applied to certain VR content such as 360$\,^{\circ}$ video. Consequently, this paper describes an exploratory study comparing and combining such techniques (independent visual background and restricted field of view) in 360$\,^{\circ}$ video. The work provides constructive insights for VR designers, while also exploring how analytics of VR content and user experience can be used for VIMS prevention and evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Many techniques have been proposed for navigation using head-mounted-displays (HMDs) in virtual reality (VR). A walking-in-place (WIP) interface for virtual locomotion provides a high presence and an immersive experience in a virtual environment (VE). However, most of the WIP techniques can only navigate users in the direction of their gaze. Other WIP methods considering virtual locomotion direction have complex configurations or are only feasible when the tracking spaces are not limited. This paper proposes a WIP interface independent of gaze direction based on the data analysis of waist-mounted inertial sensors. Our method can navigate in the locomotion direction by calculating the orientation of the pelvis. We experimentally compared two WIP methods using a navigation task that required participants to periodically observe the surrounding VE: (1) Conventional WIP (gaze-based direction) (2) Proposed WIP (pelvis-based direction). While there was no difference in learnability or cybersickness between the two methods, the proposed method had shorter task time and higher efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Camera relocalization is a common problem in several applications such as augmented reality or robot navigation. Especially, augmented reality requires fast, accurate and robust camera localization. However, it is still challenging to have a both real-time and accurate method. In this paper, we present our hybrid method combing machine learning approach and geometric approach for real-time camera relocalization from a single RGB image. We propose a light Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called xyzNet to efficiently and robustly regress 3D world coordinates of key-points in an image. Then, the geometric information about 2D-3D correspondences allows the removal of ambiguous predictions and the calculation of more accurate camera pose. Moreover, we show favorable results compared to previous machine learning based approaches about the accuracy and the performance of our method on different datasets as well as the capacity to address challenges concerning dynamic scene.},

	Abstract = {This workshop focuses on the functional requirements for enterprise AR components. Enterprise AR customers have requirements that differ substantially from those of consumers. Having functional requirements directly benefits enterprise customers: products and services will have interoperability, customer RFPs will be easier to create and respond to, and research as well as development communities will have more clear understanding of the requirements of enterprise AR buyers. Those ISMAR attendees conducting research about enterprise AR and providers of AR components and solutions will have clear definitions of customer needs. This will lead to the highest value research and greater enterprise AR project success which can then be used to influence research agendas, development roadmaps and future products. A preliminary set of enterprise AR requirements was created in 2016 through a collaboration between UI LABS (DMDII) and the AREA and delivered through a project led by Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble. In 2017 and 2018, through several additional cycles of input by stakeholders, these requirements have since been refined. This workshop will shed new light on the requirements' current status, and provide valuable inputs to the further refinement and applications of the enterprise AR requirement documents.},

Many challenges and open research questions remain - mostly in the area of multimodality and interaction. For example, current setups predominantly focus on visual and auditory senses, neglecting other modalities such as touch and smell that are an integral part of how we experience the real world around us.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a study examining interaction methods for manipulating objects in augmented reality (AR) environments using Google Glass (Glass). We compared five interaction methods; three of them were implemented on Glass (virtual buttons, swipe pad of Glass, remote control via the touchscreen of a smartwatch) and two on a smartphone (virtual buttons and the touch interaction). 32 participants were asked to scale and rotate a virtual 3D object created from a physical sculpture of the Museum G{\"u}nter Grass-Haus in Luebeck using the AR-App InfoGrid4Glass. We studied the interaction methods by measuring effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the users. The results of the study showed that smartphone interaction is superior to any Google Glass interaction methods. Of the interaction methods implemented for Glass, a combination of Glass with a smartwatch shows the highest usability. Our findings suggest that if users have a smartwatch available, it offers them a higher usability for interacting with virtual objects rather than using the touch pad of Glass or virtual buttons on Glass.},

	Abstract = {Realistic full-body avatar representation inside Virtual Reality is a big shortcoming of state-of-the-art VR systems. It remains a technically challenging task to capture human motion precisely without marker-based full-body tracking systems, which are expensive and impractical. Trying to tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet efficient approach for avatar motion reconstruction. VIRTOOAIR (VIrtual Reality TOOlbox for Avatar Intelligent Reconstruction) combines Deep Learning for upper body reconstruction and most recent methods for single camera based pose recovery for the lower body parts. Our preliminary results demonstrate the advantages of our system's avatar pose reconstruction. This is mainly determined by the use of a powerful learning system, which offers significantly better results than existing heuristic solutions for inverse kinematics. Our system supports the paradigm shift towards learning systems capable to track full-body avatars inside Virtual Reality without the need of expensive external tracking hardware.},

Currently, the development of VR technologies is opening a dimension where contemporary art practice could contribute to create the ``experience society''. An Artist is a curious people that is always experimenting and having a critic view of our current society and systems. Their contribution is not only creating new aesthetics, more is rethinking all our conventional ideas: why orthogonal/perspective perception? What about dematerialization? Body experience/reality is involving all the senses, not only visual, collective creativity versus genius creativity, post-internet concepts, etc. This disruption aptitude will open for VR technology an enormous source of innovation and promote the social wellbeing, making real an ``experience society'', where people try to transform their lives into experiential personal projects. VR does offer real potential for multidisciplinary productions, knowledge transfers and engagement beyond academic slogans. This potential is too great to be left to the market. (1).},

Therefor, modeling of real world structures is a common process within the industry. In recent years the photogrammetric tools have become available to aid in this process. However, obtaining high quality imagery is still an issue w.r.t. budget and time constraints. We present a simple, effective method for the reuse of existing video and photo material towards the generation of 3D models suitable for a virtual reality gaming environment. An abundance of existing content may be available in on-line repositories (YouTube, Flickr, Google images,..) and can be exploited. A complete video-to-VR pipeline is presented and a use-case of the Berlin Gendarmenmarkt square is tested, wherein the use of both commercial and open source software is evaluated. Our proposed method improves existing workflows used by VR game designers in both structural accuracy and creation time of real world objects.},

Unfortunately, the site underwent transformations and was affected by ancient quarrying, looting, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, thus bringing this archaeological site on the edge of ruin. For this reason, its digital documentation is important and valuable for the preservation and further study of this elite cemetery. This paper describes the work-flow towards the 3D digital recording and full immerse visualization of the monuments that compose this ancient site. These stages include the physical recording using Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), the creation of realistic 3D models from the acquired data, and the creation of a Virtual Reality (VR) world of the most paramount burial monument of this archaeological area. The obtained digital representation of the site will not only serve as a basis for geoarchaeological surveying and analysis, but also as a digital tool for public disclosure of the archaeological remains.},

	Abstract = {Although developments in devices and software are maturing towards novel Mixed Reality systems, there is too little connection to the design field. Especially if AR is combined with other ``smart'' technologies (internet of things), perspectives shift from merely technical characteristics and quantifiable human factors to more complex UX scenarios. Although there are other special interest groups/conferences that in part cover this theme (CHI, IUI, UIST), we would think that ISMAR is a better venue in connecting the graphics/tracking community with design researchers. We also would like to address the lack of software engineering skills with design students/professionals. How can we bridge these disciplines and silos of innovation? This workshop invites both industrial and academic participants to contribute to this debate, first of all by submitting extended abstracts that cover case studies, best practices and challenges in design for/with AR. To cater for a design debate, we strongly encourage submissions of annotated artworks/3D scenes/pictures/floorplans as well as more traditional papers. Position papers should be 2-6 pages long, submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ISMAR 2018 paper template available from https://ismar2018.org/guidelines_submission/index.html. Papers will be peer-reviewed and after acceptance be published in the adjunct proceedings or ISMAR. During the workshop papers will be presented/demonstrations as short presentations. Submissions should not be anonymized and the author names and affiliations should be displayed on the first page.

This enables both creating a continuous innovation life cycle and achieving long-term motivation. Our prototype was evaluated in the context of technology-enhanced learning at a medical school.
